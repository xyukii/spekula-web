<p>The culprit? He wasn&#8217;t offering Bacs Direct Debit, which is a payment method that many UK customers prefer for recurring payments.</p>



<p>We spent a weekend researching solutions, and I was amazed at how quickly we got Bacs Direct Debit working on his WordPress site using WP Simple Pay.</p>



<p>No developer calls, no complicated setup‚Äîjust a plugin that made accepting this payment method as easy as accepting credit cards.</p>



<p>That experience made me realize how many WordPress site owners may be losing sales simply because they don‚Äôt know how easy it is to offer more payment options. </p>



<p>I&#8217;ve since tested the top solutions, and I&#8217;m here to show you exactly how to set up Bacs Direct Debit on your website without any technical headaches. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">üí°Quick Answer: How to Accept Bacs Direct Debit Payments</h4>



<p>In a hurry? If you just want the solutions without all the details, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôll be covering:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Method 1: WP Simple Pay</strong> ‚Äì Best for services, subscriptions, or single products. No online store needed.</li>



<li><strong>Method 2: WooCommerce (Manual Bacs Payments)</strong> ‚Äì Uses built-in ‚ÄúBacs/Direct Bank Transfer.‚Äù Simple setup, but manual verification is required.</li>



<li><strong>Method 3: WooCommerce (Automated Direct Debit Plugin)</strong> ‚Äì Fully automated solution for WooCommerce stores with recurring payments.</li>
</ul>



<p>These three methods cover most use cases. I recommend picking the one that matches your product type and store setup.</p>

<details class="wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow"><summary><strong>What is Bacs Direct Debit?</strong></summary>
<p>Bacs Direct Debit is a simple way for businesses to <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/wordpress-payments-processing-beginners-guide/" title="WordPress Payment Processing: The Ultimate Guide for Beginners">collect payments</a> directly from a UK customer‚Äôs bank account. It‚Äôs perfect for subscriptions, memberships, or recurring invoices.</p>



<p>Bacs stands for &#8216;Bankers‚Äô Automated Clearing Services&#8217; and is widely used in the UK to move money safely between accounts. </p>



<p>Unlike credit cards or <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/10-wordpress-paypal-plugins-for-easily-accepting-payments/" title="Best WordPress PayPal Plugins for Easily Accepting Payments">PayPal</a>, payments go directly from the bank. This means customers don‚Äôt need to enter their details each time.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs also super popular. Many UK adults use it to pay regular bills, and billions of pounds move this way each month.</p>
</details>



<details class="wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow"><summary><strong>Why Accept Bacs Direct Debit Payments?</strong></summary>
<p>It‚Äôs simple, reliable, and something UK customers already trust. Here are the main benefits of using Bacs:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>üí∞ <strong>Lower transaction fees</strong> ‚Äì Usually <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-reduce-stripe-transaction-fees-in-wordpress/" title="How to Reduce Stripe Transaction Fees in WordPress (Expert Tips)">more affordable</a> than credit cards or PayPal.</li>



<li>üõ°Ô∏è <strong>Higher customer trust</strong> ‚Äì Backed by the UK Direct Debit Guarantee.</li>



<li>üåç <strong>Widely adopted in the UK</strong> ‚Äì Millions of businesses and customers already use it.</li>



<li>üîÑ <strong>Easy recurring billing</strong> ‚Äì Perfect for <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-add-subscriptions-to-woocommerce-free-alternative/" title="How to Add Subscriptions to WooCommerce (Free and Easy)">subscriptions</a> or regular payments.</li>



<li>‚ö° <strong>Fewer payment failures</strong> ‚Äì Bank-to-bank payments are generally more reliable.</li>



<li>üìà <strong>Better cash flow management</strong> ‚Äì Scheduled payments arrive automatically, making business planning easier.</li>



<li>üëç <strong>Convenient for customers</strong> ‚Äì No need to remember card details or log in to multiple accounts.</li>
</ul>



<p>Overall, offering Bacs Direct Debit makes paying easier for UK customers. It reduces friction at checkout and improves your chances of getting paid on time.</p>
</details>



<details class="wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow"><summary><strong>UK Rules for Collecting Bacs Direct Debit Payments</strong></summary>
<p>Before you start, here are the main rules to know when collecting Direct Debit payments:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>üîë <strong>Service User Number (SUN):</strong> You will need a SUN to collect payments. This license number shows Bacs that your business is approved to take payments from customer accounts. Big companies can often get one from their bank. Smaller businesses usually can‚Äôt, so they work through a bureau instead.</li>



<li>üè¢ <strong>Bacs-approved bureau:</strong> This is a trusted third party approved by Bacs. If you don‚Äôt qualify for your own SUN, a bureau lets you use theirs. They handle the technical and compliance parts for you. </li>



<li>üîí <strong>GDPR (data protection):</strong> You must handle bank details securely, only store what‚Äôs necessary, and always get the customer‚Äôs consent. <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/the-ultimate-guide-to-wordpress-and-gdpr-compliance-everything-you-need-to-know/" title="The Ultimate Guide to WordPress and GDPR Compliance">GDPR</a> is a UK/EU privacy law that protects customers‚Äô personal data, including payment info.</li>



<li>‚úÖ <strong>Strong Customer Authentication (SCA):</strong> SCA is a security rule in the UK and EU that sometimes requires an extra identity check before a payment goes through. For example, a customer may confirm a payment through their banking app or with a code sent to their phone. This one-time authorization is typically all that&#8217;s needed to set up a secure recurring payment plan.</li>



<li>üìñ <strong>Official guidance:</strong> For the latest updates, it‚Äôs always best to check the <a href="https://www.bacs.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="official Bacs website">official Bacs website</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>üëâ These steps may seem like a lot, but most small businesses use Stripe like my friend did. That way, you stay compliant while keeping the payment process smooth for both you and your customers.</p>
</details>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1: Install and Activate WP Simple Pay</h5>



<p>First, you need to sign up for an account on the <a href="https://wpsimplepay.com" target="_blank" title="WP Simple Pay - WordPress Payments Plugin">WP Simple Pay website</a>. Just click on the &#8216;Get WP Simple Pay Now&#8217; button and follow the signup instructions. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wpsimplepay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="356" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wpsimplepay.png" alt="WP Simple Pay website" class="wp-image-245369" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wpsimplepay.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wpsimplepay-300x157.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></figure>


<div class="wpb-alert style-yellow">

<p>üö®<strong>Note: </strong>WP Simple Pay has a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/stripe" target="_blank" title="WP Simple Pay - Free Stripe Plugin for WordPress">free version</a>, but you‚Äôll need the Pro plan to unlock the Bacs Direct Debit payment template.</p>

</div>


<p>Next, you need to install and activate the <a href="https://wpsimplepay.com" target="_blank" title="WP Simple Pay - WordPress Payments Plugin">WP Simple Pay</a> plugin. For detailed instructions, see our tutorial on <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/" title="How to Install a WordPress Plugin ‚Äì Step by Step for Beginners">how to install a WordPress plugin</a>.</p>



<p>Upon activation, the setup wizard will automatically launch on your screen. Here, you have to click the ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs Get Started‚Äô button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="297" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/applepaywizard.png" alt="The WP Simple Pay Setup Wizard Will Start Automatically" class="wp-image-119509" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/applepaywizard.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/applepaywizard-300x131.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>This will take you to the next step, where you need to enter your license key.</p>



<p>You can find this information in your account on the WP Simple Pay website. Entering it will unlock the pro features required to accept Bacs Direct Debit payments.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="365" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/applepayactivatelicense.png" alt="You‚Äôll Be Asked to Enter Your WP Simple Pay License Key" class="wp-image-119510" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/applepayactivatelicense.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/applepayactivatelicense-300x161.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Step 2: Connect to Stripe</h5>



<p>After that, you‚Äôll be asked to connect your site with Stripe. </p>



<p>Since WP Simple Pay is a Stripe-powered plugin, it won‚Äôt work until you connect it with a Stripe account. If you don‚Äôt already have one, you can create a new Stripe account during this process.</p>



<p>Stripe is what makes the Direct Debit work in the background. Unlike card payments, Bacs takes a few working days for the money to move from your customer‚Äôs bank.</p>



<p>Once Stripe is connected, WP Simple Pay takes care of everything. For more details, check our step-by-step guide on <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-accept-payments-with-stripe-in-wordpress/" title="How to Accept Payments with Stripe in WordPress">accepting Stripe payments in WordPress</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="345" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Connect-with-Stripe-1-1.png" alt="Connect with Stripe" class="wp-image-227268" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Connect-with-Stripe-1-1.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Connect-with-Stripe-1-1-300x152.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Step 3: Configure WP Simple Pay Settings</h5>



<p>Next, the wizard will guide you to set up your email notifications. Here you can enable options to receive email notifications for payment receipts, upcoming invoices, and payment notifications.</p>



<p>You can also choose the email address where you want to receive these notifications.</p>



<p>When you‚Äôre finished, click &#8216;Save and Continue&#8217; to move to the final setup steps.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="432" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/applepayemail.png" alt="Configure Your WP Simple Pay Emails" class="wp-image-119512" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/applepayemail.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/applepayemail-300x191.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Step 4: Create a Bacs Direct Debit Payment Form</h5>



<p>At this point, WP Simple Pay will finish configuring your site, and you‚Äôll be ready to create your Bacs Direct Debit payment form.</p>



<p>For this, head over to the <strong>WP Simple Pay ¬ª Payment Forms</strong> page from your WordPress dashboard and click the &#8216;Create Your Payment Form&#8217; button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="332" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/click-create-your-payment-form-button.png" alt="Click Create your Payment form button" class="wp-image-319923" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/click-create-your-payment-form-button.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/click-create-your-payment-form-button-300x146.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>This will take you to the template library. </p>



<p>WP Simple Pay gives you plenty of premade templates, but since we‚Äôre focusing on Direct Debit, go ahead and select the &#8216;Bacs Direct Debit Form&#8217; template.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="348" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/choose-bacs-direct-debit-form-template.png" alt="Choose the Bacs Direct Debit form template in WP Simple Pay" class="wp-image-366674" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/choose-bacs-direct-debit-form-template.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/choose-bacs-direct-debit-form-template-300x154.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Once you‚Äôve done that, you‚Äôll land on the &#8216;Add New Payment Form&#8217; page. </p>



<p>Here you can add a title and description for your form. I suggest keeping these short and clear since your customers will see them during checkout. </p>



<p>With the basics in place, make sure the form type is set to &#8216;On-site payment form.&#8217; This ensures your customers can finish checkout without leaving your site. </p>



<p>If you want to add a bit more protection, I also recommend checking the &#8216;Spam &amp; Fraud Protection&#8217; box. It adds a <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-add-captcha-in-wordpress-login-and-registration-form/" title="How to Add CAPTCHA in WordPress Login and Registration Form">CAPTCHA to your form</a>, protecting it from malicious bots.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="360" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/choose-title-and-description-for-bacs-direct-debit-form-in-wpsimplepay.png" alt="Add title and description for Bacs direct debit form in WP Simple Pay" class="wp-image-366676" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/choose-title-and-description-for-bacs-direct-debit-form-in-wpsimplepay.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/choose-title-and-description-for-bacs-direct-debit-form-in-wpsimplepay-300x159.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Next, move over to the &#8216;Payment&#8217; tab on the left. This is where you‚Äôll set the price for your product or service. </p>



<p>If you‚Äôre offering a subscription, choose ‚ÄòSubscription‚Äô and click ‚ÄòAdd Price‚Äô. You can create multiple tiers, like a Basic Plan at ¬£10/month and a Premium Plan at ¬£20/month.</p>



<p>However, if you are just selling a single product and don&#8217;t need to set up recurring payments, you can choose the &#8216;One time&#8217; option and add your pricing.</p>



<p>At this stage, don‚Äôt forget to set your currency to &#8216;GBP&#8217;. </p>



<p>Bacs Direct Debit only works with British pounds. If you set a different currency, like USD or EUR, then payments won‚Äôt process correctly.</p>

<p>As you scroll down, you‚Äôll see the &#8216;Payment Methods&#8217; section. Here, you need to make sure &#8216;Bacs Direct Debit&#8217; is selected.</p>



<p>You‚Äôll also notice that WP Simple Pay supports other options like <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-accept-sepa-payments-in-wordpress/" title="How to Accept SEPA Payments in WordPress (2 Easy Ways)">SEPA</a>, Cash App, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-add-bancontact-payments-in-wordpress/" title="How to Add Bancontact Payments in WordPress (Step by Step)">Bancontact</a>, and more. </p>



<p>I recommend adding both Bacs and credit card payments so that your UK and international customers have the flexibility to pay the way they prefer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="267" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/choose-bacs-direct-debit-as-payment-option-in-wpsimplepay.png" alt="Choose Bacs direct debit as a payment option in WP Simple Pay" class="wp-image-366679" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/choose-bacs-direct-debit-as-payment-option-in-wpsimplepay.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/choose-bacs-direct-debit-as-payment-option-in-wpsimplepay-300x118.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Once that‚Äôs set, switch to the &#8216;Form Fields&#8217; tab. This is where you can decide what information you want to collect. </p>



<p>You can drag and drop fields, add new ones, or remove ones you don‚Äôt need. </p>



<p>For example, if you‚Äôre selling a digital service, you might just keep name and email. But if you‚Äôre shipping a physical product, you‚Äôll definitely want to include an Address field.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="320" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/configure-form-fields-for-bacs-direct-debit-payment-form.png" alt="Configure form fields for Bacs direct debit payment form" class="wp-image-366680" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/configure-form-fields-for-bacs-direct-debit-payment-form.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/configure-form-fields-for-bacs-direct-debit-payment-form-300x141.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Step 5: Publish Your Bacs Direct Debit Payment Form</h5>



<p>Finally, head to the &#8216;Payment Page&#8217; tab and check the ‚ÄòEnable a dedicated payment page‚Äô box.</p>



<p>WP Simple Pay will now create a standalone page for your form without any work from you.</p>



<p>You can also <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/permalinks/" title="Permalinks">set a permalink</a>, pick a color scheme for your payment form, add your business logo, and display footer text from here.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="352" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wp-customize-payment-page.png" alt="Customize the payment page" class="wp-image-299311" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wp-customize-payment-page.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wp-customize-payment-page-300x155.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Once you‚Äôre happy with the setup, click &#8216;Publish&#8217; to save your form.</p>



<p>You can now visit your WordPress website to see the Bacs Direct Debit payment form in action.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="388" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bacs-direct-debit-payment-form-preview-in-wpsimplepay.png" alt="Bacs Direct Debit payment form preview in WP Simple Pay" class="wp-image-366682" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bacs-direct-debit-payment-form-preview-in-wpsimplepay.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bacs-direct-debit-payment-form-preview-in-wpsimplepay-300x171.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>If you‚Äôd rather not use a dedicated page, you can easily add the form to any existing page.</p>



<p>To do this, just click the ‚ÄòPublish‚Äô button after adding form fields.</p>



<p>Then, open the page or post where you want to add the Bacs form and click the ‚ÄòAdd Block‚Äô (+) button in the top left corner. </p>



<p>This will open the block menu, where you have to search and add the WP Simple Pay block. Then, select the payment form you created from the dropdown menu within the block.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="357" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wp-add-wp-simple-pay-block.png" alt="Add the WP Simple Pay block to the page or post" class="wp-image-299312" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wp-add-wp-simple-pay-block.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wp-add-wp-simple-pay-block-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>When you‚Äôre done, just click the &#8216;Update&#8217; or &#8216;Publish&#8217; button to store your settings.</p>



<p>Your Bacs Direct Debit form is now live. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Method 2: Accept Bacs Payments in WooCommerce With Manual Bank Transfers</h4>



<p>If you already run a <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/woocommerce-tutorial-ultimate-guide/" title="WooCommerce Made Simple: A Step-by-Step Tutorial [+ Resources]">WooCommerce store</a> and want to reach UK customers without extra plugins, then this method works well.</p>



<p>WooCommerce comes with a built-in Direct Bank Transfer option, which works perfectly for handling Bacs payments. Customers simply choose this option at checkout, send money directly to your bank account, and you confirm the payment on your end.</p>



<p>However, before I dive into the setup, it‚Äôs important to understand the trade-offs of this approach:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>No automation:</strong> You have to check your bank account and manually mark each order as paid.</li>



<li><strong>Slower process for customers:</strong> Customers must leave your site to complete the payment through their online banking.</li>



<li><strong>Best for low volume:</strong> This works well if you only process a few orders per month, but it is not ideal for busy stores.</li>
</ul>



<p>For small or local businesses, this setup is a simple, no-fuss way to accept Bacs payments without extra costs.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1: Enable Bacs Direct Debit</h5>



<p>First, head over to your WordPress dashboard and go to <strong>WooCommerce ¬ª Settings ¬ª Payments</strong>. On this page, you‚Äôll see a list of available gateways.</p>



<p>Go ahead and click on the &#8216;Take offline payments&#8217; option.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="324" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/choose-offline-payments-option-in-woocommerce.png" alt="Choose offline payments option in WooCommerce" class="wp-image-366694" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/choose-offline-payments-option-in-woocommerce.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/choose-offline-payments-option-in-woocommerce-300x143.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>This will bring up a screen where WooCommerce lists all the offline payment methods it supports, like Direct Bank Transfer, Check Payments, and Cash on Delivery.</p>



<p>Here, simply click the &#8216;Enable&#8217; button next to the &#8216;Direct Bank Transfer&#8217; option.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="308" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/click-enable-next-to-direct-bank-transfer-in-woocommerce.png" alt="Click Enable next to direct bank transfer in WooCommerce" class="wp-image-366695" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/click-enable-next-to-direct-bank-transfer-in-woocommerce.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/click-enable-next-to-direct-bank-transfer-in-woocommerce-300x136.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Step 2: Configure Bacs Direct Debit Payment Settings</h5>



<p>Now, click the &#8216;Manage&#8217; button next to the Direct bank transfer option to adjust the settings.</p>



<p>You will now be directed to a new page where you can change the title and description that appear at checkout. </p>



<p>By default, it says &#8216;Direct Bank Transfer,&#8217; but you can edit this to &#8216;Bacs Direct Debit&#8217; or something clearer for your UK customers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="337" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/change-title-and-description-for-direct-bank-transfer-in-woocommerce.png" alt="Change title and description for direct bank transfer in WooCommerce" class="wp-image-366696" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/change-title-and-description-for-direct-bank-transfer-in-woocommerce.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/change-title-and-description-for-direct-bank-transfer-in-woocommerce-300x150.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Scroll down a bit, and you‚Äôll find the &#8216;Instructions&#8217; box. This is the text WooCommerce will show customers after they place an order. </p>



<p>Here, I suggest adding simple directions like your bank name, account number, and sort code so customers know where to send their payment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="230" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/add-your-bank-info-for-customers-in-woocommerce.png" alt="Add your bank info for customers in WooCommerce" class="wp-image-366698" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/add-your-bank-info-for-customers-in-woocommerce.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/add-your-bank-info-for-customers-in-woocommerce-300x101.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Finally, under &#8216;Account Details&#8217;, you have to enter the exact bank information that WooCommerce will display on the thank-you page and order emails. </p>



<p>If you work with multiple bank accounts, you can even add more than one here.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="258" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/connect-your-bank-account-with-woocommerce.png" alt="Connect your bank account with WooCommerce" class="wp-image-366700" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/connect-your-bank-account-with-woocommerce.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/connect-your-bank-account-with-woocommerce-300x114.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>When everything looks good, don‚Äôt forget to click &#8216;Save Changes&#8217; at the bottom to store your settings.</p>



<p>Now, you can visit your <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-start-an-online-store/" title="How to Start an Online Store (Step by Step for Beginners)">online store</a> to see the Bacs Direct Debit payment option in action.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="328" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bacs-direct-debit-shown-as-payment-option-in-woocommerce.png" alt="Bacs direct debit shown as a payment option in WooCommerce" class="wp-image-366703" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bacs-direct-debit-shown-as-payment-option-in-woocommerce.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bacs-direct-debit-shown-as-payment-option-in-woocommerce-300x145.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Method 3: Accept Bacs Direct Debit Payments in WooCommerce With a Plugin (For Automated Payments)</h4>



<p>If the manual process in Method 2 seems too time-consuming for your WooCommerce store, then this automated solution is the perfect alternative.</p>



<p>Unlike manual bank transfers, Stripe handles everything in the background. From approving the mandate to collecting funds, you don‚Äôt have to check payments individually.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1: Set Up the Payment Gateway Plugin</h5>



<p>For this, you need to install and activate the free <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/payment-gateway-stripe-and-woocommerce-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="Payment Gateway for Stripe and for WooCommerce">Payment Gateway for Stripe and for WooCommerce</a> plugin. </p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t know how to do that, you can follow our guide on <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/" title="How to Install a WordPress Plugin ‚Äì Step by Step for Beginners">installing a WordPress plugin</a>.</p>



<p>Upon activation, you have to connect the plugin with Stripe. To do that, visit the <strong>WebToffee Stripe</strong>¬†page in your WordPress dashboard and click the ‚ÄòConnect to Stripe‚Äô button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="289" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/click-connect-to-stripe-button.png" alt="Click Connect to Stripe button" class="wp-image-320353" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/click-connect-to-stripe-button.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/click-connect-to-stripe-button-300x128.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>This will open a window, where you can log in to your existing Stripe account or create a new one. When the connection is complete, you‚Äôll see a confirmation screen showing your store is linked.</p>



<p>By default, Stripe starts in <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-test-stripe-payments-in-wordpress/" title="How to Test Stripe Payments on a WordPress Site (Easy Methods)">test mode</a>, but you can switch to live mode anytime from the top right corner.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="233" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/stripe-is-connect-to-your-woocommerce-store.png" alt="Stripe is now connected to your WooCommerce store" class="wp-image-366713" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/stripe-is-connect-to-your-woocommerce-store.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/stripe-is-connect-to-your-woocommerce-store-300x103.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Step 2: Turn on Bacs Direct Debit Payments</h5>



<p>Next, switch to the &#8216;Local Gateways&#8217; page and select the &#8216;Bacs&#8217; option.</p>



<p>Then, check the ‚ÄòEnable‚Äô box to add Bacs as a payment method in your store.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="341" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/enable-bacs-direct-debit-in-woocommerce-with-a-plugin.png" alt="Enable Bacs direct debit in WooCommerce with a plugin" class="wp-image-366714" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/enable-bacs-direct-debit-in-woocommerce-with-a-plugin.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/enable-bacs-direct-debit-in-woocommerce-with-a-plugin-300x150.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>You can also edit the title, description, and button text at checkout. This makes the process clear and simple for UK customers.</p>



<p>For example, you might change the title to ‚ÄòPay by Direct Debit (Bacs)‚Äô. You can also use the description to explain that the payment will be collected through their bank once they approve the mandate (the customer&#8217;s permission for you to collect payments).</p>



<p>Adjusting the button text to something simple like &#8216;Authorize Direct Debit&#8217; can also make the process feel more trustworthy and transparent.</p>


<div class="wpb-alert style-yellow">

<p>üìå  <strong>Important Note:</strong> Make sure your <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-add-a-currency-converter-in-wordpress/" title="How to Add a Currency Converter in WordPress (2 Easy Ways)">store currency</a> is set to GBP (¬£). Bacs only works with pounds, so this step is essential.</p>

</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="326" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/add-title-and-description-for-bacs.png" alt="Add title and description for Bacs payments" class="wp-image-366715" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/add-title-and-description-for-bacs.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/add-title-and-description-for-bacs-300x144.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Once you are done, don‚Äôt forget to click &#8216;Save changes&#8217; to store your settings.</p>



<p>You can now visit your WooCommerce store to see the automated Bacs direct debit payment option.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="365" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/preview-of-bacs-direct-debit-in-woocommerce.png" alt="Preview of Bacs direct debit in WooCommerce" class="wp-image-366716" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/preview-of-bacs-direct-debit-in-woocommerce.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/preview-of-bacs-direct-debit-in-woocommerce-300x161.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">üîêSecurity Best Practices for Accepting Bacs Direct Debit in WordPress</h4>



<p>Once you‚Äôve set up Bacs payments on your website, the next step is making sure everything runs securely in the background. </p>



<p>Here are some important steps you‚Äôll want to follow:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Install an SSL Certificate: </strong>An SSL certificate ensures that customer data (like bank details) is encrypted during checkout. Most hosting providers now <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-add-free-ssl-in-wordpress-with-lets-encrypt/" title="How to Add Free SSL in WordPress with Let‚Äôs Encrypt">offer free SSL</a>, and it‚Äôs a must-have for any WordPress site that processes payments. </li>



<li><strong>Use a Reliable Security Plugin:</strong> A tool like <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Sucuri" href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/sucuri/" data-nojs="1" data-shortcode="true">Sucuri</a> or Cloudflare can help you monitor threats, block suspicious traffic, and scan for malware automatically. To get started, take a look at our <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-security/" title="The Ultimate WordPress Security Guide ‚Äì Step by Step">ultimate WordPress security guide</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Enable Payment Logging:</strong> Both WP Simple Pay and WooCommerce <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-monitor-user-activity-in-wordpress-with-simple-history/" title="How to Monitor User Activity in WordPress With Security Audit Logs">let you log payment events</a>. This gives you a record of failed or suspicious payment attempts, which is really helpful for spotting fraud early.</li>



<li><strong>Keep WordPress, Themes, and Plugins Updated: </strong>Outdated software is one of the biggest security risks. You need to <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/ultimate-guide-to-upgrade-wordpress-for-beginners-infograph/" title="Beginner‚Äôs Guide: How to Safely Update WordPress (Infographic)">regularly update your WordPress core</a>, plugins, and themes to keep your site secure.</li>



<li><strong>Limit Admin Access:</strong> If you‚Äôre not the only person managing your store, then make sure each team member has the right role. For example, don‚Äôt give someone full admin access if they only need to manage orders. To get started, see our guide on <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/wordpress-user-roles-and-permissions/" title="Beginner‚Äôs Guide to WordPress User Roles and Permissions">managing user roles and permissions</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Regular Backups: </strong>Finally, always have a backup plan. I set up automated daily backups with <a href="https://duplicator.com" target="_blank" title="Duplicator - Best WordPress Backup and Migration Plugin">Duplicator</a> so that if something goes wrong, I can easily restore my site. To do the same, take a look at our tutorial on <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-backup-your-wordpress-site/" title="How to Backup Your WordPress Site (Ultimate Guide)">how to back up your WordPress site</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>By taking these precautions, you‚Äôll make sure your Bacs Direct Debit setup isn‚Äôt just working ‚Äî it‚Äôs also secure and trustworthy for your customers.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Troubleshooting Common Issues with Bacs Direct Debit Payments</h4>



<p>Even with everything set up correctly, there may be times when Bacs payments don‚Äôt go through as expected. </p>



<p>When my friend first launched his subscription box with Bacs Direct Debit, we also ran into a few hiccups ‚Äî but with the right troubleshooting steps, they were easy to fix.</p>



<p>Here are some of the most common issues and how you can handle them:</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Set Up Proper Error Notifications</h5>



<p>By default, Stripe logs every failed payment attempt. But you‚Äôll want to go into your Stripe dashboard and enable email notifications for both you and your customers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="230" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/send-customer-email-upon-failed-transaction.png" alt="Send a customer email upon failed transaction" class="wp-image-366718" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/send-customer-email-upon-failed-transaction.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/send-customer-email-upon-failed-transaction-300x101.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>This way, customers instantly see why their payment didn‚Äôt go through, and you‚Äôll also get an alert so you can follow up quickly. </p>



<p>Without this step, it‚Äôs easy to miss failed payments until much later.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Payment Failures or Declined Transactions</h5>



<p>Sometimes a payment fails because the customer‚Äôs bank doesn&#8217;t approve the mandate, or because the account details were entered incorrectly.</p>



<p>In these cases, you should advise your customers to double-check their information or contact their bank.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Managing Failed Payment Recovery</strong></h5>



<p>Inside the Stripe dashboard, you can set up automated retries for failed payments. </p>



<p>This is especially useful for subscriptions, because a single failed payment doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve lost the customer. </p>



<p>Stripe can attempt the charge again after a few days, and you can also send a reminder email with a link to update payment details. </p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Contacting Payment Provider Support</strong></h5>



<p>If you‚Äôve tried the basics and the issue still isn‚Äôt resolved, then don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to your payment provider.</p>



<p>Stripe offers detailed error logs and live support, which can come in handy when you aren&#8217;t sure if the issue is from your end or the customer‚Äôs bank.</p>



<p>üîë<strong>The key takeaway?</strong> Most Bacs issues aren‚Äôt permanent roadblocks ‚Äî they just need clear communication with your customers and a quick check inside your Stripe or WooCommerce dashboard. With the right notifications and follow-up, you can keep things running smoothly without losing sales.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Other Payment Options to Consider (Besides Bacs)</h4>



<p>While Bacs Direct Debit is great for UK customers who prefer bank payments, it‚Äôs not the only option you should have on your checkout page.</p>



<p>In fact, offering <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-wordpress-payment-plugins/" title="Best WordPress Payment Plugins (Tested &amp; Verified)">multiple payment methods</a> gives customers more flexibility and can reduce cart abandonment.</p>



<p>Here are a few alternatives you may want to add alongside Bacs:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>üí≥ Card Payments (Stripe/PayPal): </strong>The fastest and most common option worldwide. Most UK shoppers use debit or credit cards, so enabling <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-accept-payments-with-stripe-in-wordpress/" title="How to Accept Payments with Stripe in WordPress">Stripe</a> or <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/10-wordpress-paypal-plugins-for-easily-accepting-payments/" title="10 Best WordPress PayPal Plugins for Easily Accepting Payments">PayPal</a> card payments ensures your checkout feels familiar and convenient.</li>



<li><strong>‚ö° Faster Payments (UK):</strong> This is another bank transfer method. But unlike Bacs, it clears within minutes instead of a few days. Great for one-off or urgent payments.</li>



<li><strong>üí∞ PayPal Recurring: </strong>For subscription-based services, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-accept-recurring-payments-in-wordpress/" title="How to Accept Recurring Payments in WordPress (4 Methods)">PayPal recurring payments</a> are a trusted choice. Many customers already have PayPal accounts, so they feel more comfortable subscribing with it.</li>



<li><strong>üè¶ ACH (US Customers): </strong><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-accept-ach-payments-in-wordpress/" title="How to Accept ACH Payments in WordPress (Recurring or One-Time)">ACH</a> is basically the American version of Bacs. If you also sell to US customers, it‚Äôs worth enabling. Like Bacs, payments take a few days to clear but are cheaper than card transactions.</li>



<li><strong>üåç SEPA Direct Debit (EU Customers): </strong>SEPA is the European equivalent of Bacs. If your WooCommerce store attracts buyers from the EU, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-accept-sepa-payments-in-wordpress/" title="How to Accept SEPA Payments in WordPress (2 Easy Ways)">enabling SEPA</a> gives them a familiar and local payment option.</li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Frequently Asked Questions About Bacs Direct Debit Payments</h5>



<p>Here are some questions that our readers frequently ask about Bacs direct debit payments:</p>



<p><strong>Do I need a developer to set up Bacs Direct Debit in WordPress?</strong></p>



<p>No, you don‚Äôt need a developer. Plugins like WP Simple Pay and WooCommerce make the process straightforward. As long as you‚Äôre comfortable installing and configuring plugins, you‚Äôll be able to handle the setup on your own.</p>



<p><strong>How much does it cost to accept Bacs Direct Debit?</strong></p>



<p>Bacs is usually cheaper than card payments. If you‚Äôre using Stripe, the fee is about 1% per transaction + 20p, capped at ¬£2. This makes it one of the most affordable payment methods for UK businesses, especially if you process larger transactions.</p>



<p><strong>Is Bacs Direct Debit safe for my customers?</strong></p>



<p>Yes. Bacs payments are protected by the Direct Debit Guarantee, which means customers are covered against any errors or unauthorized payments. Plus, Stripe and WooCommerce handle the technical security, and with SSL enabled on your site, sensitive data stays encrypted.</p>



<p><strong>Do I need a Service User Number (SUN) for Bacs Direct Debit payments?</strong></p>



<p>If you‚Äôre a small business using Stripe with WP Simple Pay or WooCommerce, you don‚Äôt need to apply for a SUN directly. Stripe works with a Bacs-approved bureau, which provides the SUN on your behalf.</p>



<p>However, if you wanted to collect Direct Debit payments directly through your bank without a provider like Stripe, then yes, you would need to apply for your own SUN. Keep in mind that this can be a lengthy and difficult process for new or smaller businesses.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why Connect Amazon FBA (MCF) to Your WooCommerce Store?</h4>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>You will need to set up your WooCommerce store before starting this tutorial.

</div>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-1">üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Set Up Your Amazon MCF Account</h4>



<p>Before you can connect Amazon to your WooCommerce store, you need to make sure your Amazon FBA account is properly set up. </p>



<p>First, you‚Äôll need to have a Professional Seller account on Amazon. If you don&#8217;t already have one, head over to <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="Amazon Seller Central">sellercentral.amazon.com</a> to sign up.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="332" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sign-up-for-amazon-seller-account.png" alt="Sign up for an Amazon Seller account" class="wp-image-353308" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sign-up-for-amazon-seller-account.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sign-up-for-amazon-seller-account-300x146.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>


<div class="wpb-alert style-yellow">

<p>üö®<strong>Important:</strong>&nbsp;You must sign up for a&nbsp;Professional Seller account. The Individual plan does not support the necessary tools for this integration.</p>

</div>


<p>Once you enter your <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-create-a-free-business-email-address-in-5-minutes-step-by-step/" title="How to Create a Free Business Email Address (in Just 5 Minutes)">email address</a> and create a password, Amazon will send you a verification code. This is just to make sure your email is valid. </p>



<p>After you enter the correct code, Amazon will take you to the next screen and outline the steps needed to complete your account setup.</p>



<p>Make sure you have the following documents ready:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A valid government-issued ID (like a passport or driver‚Äôs license)</li>



<li>A recent bank account or credit card statement</li>



<li>A chargeable credit card</li>



<li>Your mobile phone</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="334" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/amazon-seller-account-requirements.png" alt="Amazon seller account requirements" class="wp-image-353309" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/amazon-seller-account-requirements.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/amazon-seller-account-requirements-300x147.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Amazon will then ask for your<a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-properly-add-your-business-address-in-wordpress/" title="How to Properly Add Your Business Address in WordPress"> business location</a> and business type.</p>



<p>Be sure to select the country where your business is located because Amazon will verify it later.</p>



<p>For business type, you can choose from several options such as State-owned business, Publicly-owned business, Privately-owned business, Charity, or &#8216;None, I am an individual.&#8217; </p>



<p>If you haven‚Äôt officially registered your business yet, just select the last option. You‚Äôll also need to enter your full name and click &#8216;Agree and continue.&#8217;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="375" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/add-business-location-and-type.png" alt="Add business location and type" class="wp-image-353310" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/add-business-location-and-type.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/add-business-location-and-type-300x165.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>In the next step, you need to give your personal information, including a form of identification (either your passport number or driver‚Äôs license number). </p>



<p>After that, you‚Äôll be asked to verify your mobile phone number by entering a PIN code that Amazon sends via text or call. </p>



<p>Once you enter the code correctly, your phone number will be verified. When everything looks good, click &#8216;Next&#8217; to continue.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="346" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/add-personal-information.png" alt="Add personal information" class="wp-image-353311" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/add-personal-information.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/add-personal-information-300x153.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Now you‚Äôll be asked for your billing information. This includes a valid credit card and bank account number. </p>



<p>Amazon needs this to charge your monthly fees and deposit your earnings from sales.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="308" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/provide-bank-info.png" alt="Provide bank information" class="wp-image-353312" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/provide-bank-info.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/provide-bank-info-300x136.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Once your billing info is verified, you‚Äôll move on to a few questions about your products and your Amazon store. Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî you don‚Äôt need to overthink this part. </p>



<p>You‚Äôll be asked to enter a name for your Amazon store (you can change it later), and answer a few product-related questions, like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Do you have UPC codes for your products?</li>



<li>Do you have any diversity certifications?</li>



<li>Are you the manufacturer or brand owner?</li>



<li>Do you have a government-registered trademark?</li>
</ul>



<p>Answer these based on your situation, and click &#8216;Next.&#8217;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="341" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/answer-store-related-questions.png" alt="Answer store related questions" class="wp-image-353313" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/answer-store-related-questions.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/answer-store-related-questions-300x150.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>At this point, you‚Äôll need to upload your ID (like a passport or license) and a bank statement to verify your identity. Once submitted, Amazon will ask you to complete a video call with one of its associates.</p>



<p>This required video call helps Amazon verify your identity by matching your face to the documents you submitted.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="384" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/identity-and-address-verification-1.png" alt="Identity and address verification" class="wp-image-353315" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/identity-and-address-verification-1.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/identity-and-address-verification-1-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>After the video call and final review, your account will be approved, and you‚Äôll be able to log in to your Amazon Seller Central dashboard.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-2-create-an-fba-product-listing-for-your-woocommerce-product">üìÑ Step 2: Create an FBA Product Listing for Your WooCommerce Products</h4>



<p>Now that your Amazon Seller account is ready, it‚Äôs time to set up the actual product listings that Amazon will fulfill.</p>



<p>For every product you want Amazon to ship, you&#8217;ll need to create a matching product listing in your Amazon Seller Central account.</p>



<p>To do this, log in to the Seller Central dashboard and head over to the <strong>Catalogue ¬ª Add Product</strong> page. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="373" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/visit-add-products-page-on-seller-account-dashboard.png" alt="Visit the Add Products page on the seller account dashboard" class="wp-image-353316" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/visit-add-products-page-on-seller-account-dashboard.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/visit-add-products-page-on-seller-account-dashboard-300x165.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>If your product already exists on Amazon, you can match it.</p>



<p>But if it‚Äôs unique to your <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-start-an-online-store/" title="How to Start an Online Store (Step by Step for Beginners)">online store</a>, you‚Äôll need to create a new listing by entering all the details manually.</p>


<div class="wpb-alert style-yellow">

<p>üí°<strong>Quick Tip:</strong>&nbsp;It‚Äôs usually best to create a new listing for your brand. This gives you full control over the product title, images, and description. If you match an existing listing, you‚Äôll be selling on a product page that someone else controls.</p>

</div>


<p>Then, click the &#8216;Sell this product&#8217; button. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="318" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/add-product-details.png" alt="Add product details" class="wp-image-353317" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/add-product-details.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/add-product-details-300x140.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>This will direct you to a new screen where you‚Äôll just need to enter basic details like quantity, price, and fulfillment channel. </p>


<div class="wpb-alert style-blue">

<p>üí°<strong>Just one quick note:</strong> Amazon assigns each product a Seller SKU, which you‚Äôll need later to match with your WooCommerce product. I recommend copying these into a spreadsheet so that you can easily access them later.</p>



<p>Think of the SKU as a product‚Äôs secret code ‚Äî WooCommerce and Amazon must use the exact same code so the plugin knows which item to ship.</p>



<p>For example, if your product&#8217;s SKU is&nbsp;<code>TSHIRT-BLUE-LG</code>&nbsp;in WooCommerce, you must enter&nbsp;<code>TSHIRT-BLUE-LG</code>&nbsp;as the Seller SKU in your Amazon listing for the connection to work.</p>

</div>


<p>For FBA, be sure to choose &#8216;Amazon will ship and provide customer service for this product.&#8217; This tells Amazon to handle the product using FBA instead of making you ship it yourself.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="264" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/configure-fullfilment-channel-details.png" alt="Configure fulfillment channel details " class="wp-image-353318" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/configure-fullfilment-channel-details.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/configure-fullfilment-channel-details-300x116.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Once the listing is complete, save it and repeat the process for other products on your website.</p>



<p>You‚Äôll now be able to send that product‚Äôs inventory to Amazon and make it eligible for both FBA and Multi-Channel Fulfillment (MCF) ‚Äî which means Amazon can ship it when an order comes from your WooCommerce store.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-3-send-your-inventory-to-amazon-using-send-to-amazon">üì¶ Step 3: Send Your Inventory to Amazon Using ‚ÄúSend to Amazon‚Äù</h4>



<p>Once your product is listed in Amazon Seller Central and marked for FBA, the next step is to send your inventory to Amazon‚Äôs warehouse. </p>



<p>This is how your WooCommerce product becomes eligible for multi-channel fulfillment.</p>



<p>To do this, you‚Äôll use Amazon‚Äôs Send to Amazon shipment workflow, which replaces the old shipping process with a more streamlined system. </p>



<p>Amazon will inform you which fulfillment center(s) to ship to and may request that you split your shipment across multiple locations to help distribute inventory throughout their network.</p>



<p>Start by going to your <strong>Manage All Inventory</strong> page in Seller Central. </p>



<p>Here, find the product you want to ship and click the &#8216;Edit&#8217; dropdown next to it. Then, select the  &#8216;Send/Replenish Inventory&#8217; option. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="306" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/click-send-replenish-inventory.png" alt="Click the Send/Replenish Inventory button" class="wp-image-353333" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/click-send-replenish-inventory.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/click-send-replenish-inventory-300x135.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>This will open the Send to Amazon setup, where the platform will ask for your packing details.</p>



<p>You‚Äôll need to enter the number of units you‚Äôre placing in each box, the box dimensions and weight, and whether Amazon or you will apply the product labels.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="351" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/configure-packing-details.png" alt="Configure packing details" class="wp-image-353336" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/configure-packing-details.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/configure-packing-details-300x155.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>You can save this as a template if you plan to use the same box setup again later. </p>



<p>Once that‚Äôs done, enter the number of units you want to send, then click &#8216;Ready to Send&#8217; followed by &#8216;Confirm and Continue.&#8217;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="181" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/click-ready-to-send.png" alt="Click the Ready to Send button" class="wp-image-353339" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/click-ready-to-send.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/click-ready-to-send-300x80.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Next, you‚Äôll choose your shipping method. Most WooCommerce sellers use Small Parcel Delivery (SPD) for individual boxes, especially if you‚Äôre using Amazon‚Äôs partnered carrier, like UPS. </p>



<p>You can also go with Less Than Truckload (LTL) if you‚Äôre shipping pallets. Amazon will show you rate options for each. </p>



<p>After choosing your ship date and carrier, click the &#8216;Accept charges and confirm shipping&#8217;  button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="329" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/choose-shipping-mode.png" alt="Choose a shipping mode" class="wp-image-353341" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/choose-shipping-mode.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/choose-shipping-mode-300x145.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Now it‚Äôs time to print your shipping labels and add them to the boxes you plan to ship. You can then drop off the boxes at UPS or schedule a pickup.</p>



<p>Once your inventory is live, you&#8217;re ready to connect your WooCommerce store to Amazon FBA.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-4-connect-woocommerce-to-amazon-fba-using-the-never-settle-plugin">üîß Step 4: Connect WooCommerce to Amazon FBA Using a Plugin</h4>



<p>Now that your inventory is active in Amazon FBA, you can connect your WooCommerce store to Amazon using the <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/woocommerce-amazon-fulfillment-mcf-for-woocommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="WooCommerce Amazon Fulfillment (MCF) for WooCommerce">Amazon Fulfillment for WooCommerce</a> plugin. </p>



<p>This tool allows orders from your WooCommerce store to be automatically fulfilled by Amazon without you having to manually ship anything.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-set-up-the-amazon-fulfillment-for-woocommerce-plugin">Set Up the Amazon Fulfillment for WooCommerce Plugin</h5>



<p>First, you need to install and activate the <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/woocommerce-amazon-fulfillment-mcf-for-woocommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="WooCommerce Amazon Fulfillment (MCF) for WooCommerce">Amazon Fulfillment for WooCommerce</a> plugin. For step-by-step instructions, see our tutorial on <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/" title="How to Install a WordPress Plugin ‚Äì Step by Step for Beginners">how to install a WordPress plugin</a>.</p>


<div class="wpb-alert style-yellow">

<p>üö®<strong>Note: </strong>Amazon Fulfillment for WooCommerce is a premium plugin and doesn&#8217;t have a free version. However, out of all the tools that I have tested, it offers the most straightforward way to connect Amazon FBA to WooCommerce.</p>

</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-connect-to-your-amazon-seller-account">Connect to Your Amazon Seller Account</h5>



<p>Upon activation, visit the <strong>WooCommerce ¬ª Settings <strong>¬ª</strong> Integration <strong>¬ª</strong> Fulfillment by Amazon</strong> page from your WordPress dashboard to start the setup process.</p>



<p>Here, you‚Äôll first need to click the &#8216;Login With Amazon&#8217; button. This will direct you to a new screen where you have to add your Amazon Seller account credentials.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="269" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/login-with-amazon.png" alt="Login with Amazon" class="wp-image-354057" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/login-with-amazon.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/login-with-amazon-300x119.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>After logging in, you‚Äôll return to the plugin settings, and your &#8216;Home Region&#8217; and &#8216;Marketplace ID&#8217; will be filled in automatically. </p>



<p>Now, you have to click the ‚ÄòClick to TEST Connection between Amazon and WooCommerce‚Äô button. This confirms that your website is linked to Amazon through the Selling Partner API.</p>



<p>An API (Application Programming Interface) is like a secure bridge that lets your WooCommerce store and Amazon talk to each other automatically.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="260" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/test-amazon-api-connection.png" alt="Test Amazon API connection with WooCommerce" class="wp-image-354222" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/test-amazon-api-connection.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/test-amazon-api-connection-300x115.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-import-your-amazon-products-into-woocommerce">Import Your Amazon Products into WooCommerce</h5>



<p>Once that is done, scroll down to the &#8216;Compare and Import Products from Amazon&#8217; section and click the &#8216;Compare &amp; Import your Products into WooCommerce by SKU&#8217; button. </p>



<p>This pulls product data directly from your Amazon catalog and matches it with your WooCommerce products based on SKU.</p>


<div class="wpb-alert style-yellow">

<p>üí°<strong>Bonus Tip: </strong>The SKUs in your WooCommerce store must match the ones in your Amazon inventory. Otherwise, the plugin won‚Äôt know which product to sync.</p>

</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="164" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/check-amazon-skus.png" alt="Check Amazon SKUs" class="wp-image-354223" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/check-amazon-skus.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/check-amazon-skus-300x72.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>After that, go to the &#8216;Inventory (Stock Level) Settings&#8217; section. Here, you can click the &#8216;Click to Sync WooCommerce Stock Levels to match Amazon&#8217; button to update your inventory manually.</p>



<p>To make sure everything is syncing correctly, use the ‚ÄòTEST Inventory Connection‚Äô tool. </p>



<p>The plugin‚Äôs documentation may give a sample SKU (like OBRAMAIN) for testing, but I recommend using a real SKU from one of your own products. This will give you the most accurate test results.</p>



<p>If it works, your connection is good to go. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="199" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sync-woocommerce-and-amazon-stock-levels.png" alt="Sync WooCommerce and Amazon stock levels" class="wp-image-354224" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sync-woocommerce-and-amazon-stock-levels.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sync-woocommerce-and-amazon-stock-levels-300x88.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Below that, I recommend enabling the ‚ÄòUpdate local stock levels per Order item sent to Amazon Fulfillment‚Äô setting. This will make sure your WooCommerce inventory automatically updates whenever a customer places an order.</p>



<p>You should also check the ‚ÄòAutomatically sync stock levels from Amazon at the interval below‚Äô box to enable automatic inventory syncing. </p>



<p>By default, the plugin syncs every 1440 minutes (once a day), but you can adjust this based on how often your stock changes.</p>



<p>There‚Äôs also an option to limit syncing to FBA-enabled products only, which can be helpful if you sell a mix of products fulfilled by Amazon and others that you ship yourself.</p>



<p>You can even set a low stock threshold so you get notified when items are running out. This helps <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-prevent-overselling-out-of-stock-items-in-wordpress/" title="How to Prevent Overselling Out of Stock Items in WordPress">prevent overselling</a> and keeps your store running smoothly.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="239" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/configure-other-stock-level-settings.png" alt="Configure other stock level settings" class="wp-image-354225" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/configure-other-stock-level-settings.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/configure-other-stock-level-settings-300x105.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-customize-order-fullfillment-settings">Customize Order Fulfillment Settings</h5>



<p>Once that is done, I suggest you add an ‚ÄòOrder Prefix‚Äô under the Order Fulfillment Settings.</p>



<p>It is a small label that will be added to Amazon-fulfilled orders in your dashboard. For example, you can use something like <code>fba</code> to make those orders easy to identify.</p>



<p>You can also customize the Order Comment (for example, ‚ÄúThank you for your order!‚Äù) and set a default shipping speed.</p>



<p>This default is used when a specific shipping method isn‚Äôt matched during checkout.</p>



<p>After that, make sure to check the &#8216;Enable Shipping Method Mapping&#8217; box. This step is really important because it connects the shipping options in your WooCommerce store to the actual shipping speeds Amazon offers, like Standard, Expedited, or Priority. </p>



<p>By turning this on, you‚Äôre telling the plugin to match the options your customers see at checkout with the correct delivery methods on Amazon‚Äôs side.</p>



<p>Finally, click the &#8216;Save Changes&#8217;  button to apply all your settings. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="245" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/enable-shipping-method-mapping.png" alt="Enable shipping method mapping" class="wp-image-354226" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/enable-shipping-method-mapping.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/enable-shipping-method-mapping-300x108.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-set-up-amazon-shipping">Set Up Amazon Shipping</h5>



<p>Now it‚Äôs time to configure Amazon shipping as a method within your WooCommerce store. This step ensures your customers can choose a shipping speed, and Amazon will know exactly how to fulfill it.</p>



<p>For this, head over to the <strong>Shipping</strong> tab on the WooCommerce Settings page, and either edit an existing shipping zone or create a new one. </p>



<p>Once you do that, click the &#8216;Add Shipping Method&#8217; button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="212" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/woocommerce-add-shipping-method-min.png" alt="Adding a shipping method in WooCommerce" class="wp-image-325106" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/woocommerce-add-shipping-method-min.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/woocommerce-add-shipping-method-min-300x94.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>This will open a popup, where you have to select &#8216;Amazon&#8217; as the shipping method.</p>



<p>Then, click the &#8216;Continue&#8217; button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="338" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/choose-amazon-as-the-shipping-method.png" alt="Choose Amazon as the shipping method" class="wp-image-354227" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/choose-amazon-as-the-shipping-method.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/choose-amazon-as-the-shipping-method-300x150.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>You‚Äôll now see options to enable Standard, Expedited, and Priority shipping. Just check the boxes next to the ones you want to offer at checkout.</p>



<p>For each shipping speed, you can apply a price adjustment, either as a fixed amount or a percentage. This gives you control over how much you want to charge customers based on the shipping method they select.</p>



<p>For example, you could offer <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-add-a-free-shipping-bar-in-woocommerce/" title="How to Add a Free Shipping Bar in WooCommerce (Step by Step)">Standard shipping for free</a>, charge a small fee for Expedited, and set a premium for Priority delivery ‚Äî depending on what works for your pricing strategy.</p>

<p>Once you‚Äôre happy with the settings, click the &#8216;Create and save&#8217; button to activate Amazon shipping on your site.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-5-enable-amazon-fba-for-each-woocommerce-product">üõí Step 5: Enable Amazon FBA for Each WooCommerce Product</h4>



<p>Now that the plugin is connected and your shipping settings are in place, the final step is to enable FBA for each product you want Amazon to fulfill.</p>



<p>To do this, visit your <strong>Products ¬ª All Products</strong> page and click the &#8216;Edit&#8217; link for a product that you have already added to your Amazon inventory earlier.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="343" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/edit-product.png" alt="Click the Edit link for your preferred product" class="wp-image-327035" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/edit-product.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/edit-product-300x150.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>This will open the product editor, where you have to scroll down to the &#8216;Product Data&#8217; section and look for the &#8216;Amazon Fulfillment&#8217; tab.</p>



<p>There, you‚Äôll see a checkbox labeled &#8216;Fulfill with Amazon FBA&#8217; ‚Äî go ahead and tick that box.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="368" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/check-fullfil-with-amazon-box.png" alt="Check fulfil with Amazon FBA box" class="wp-image-353373" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/check-fullfil-with-amazon-box.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/check-fullfil-with-amazon-box-300x162.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Once selected, click the &#8216;Update&#8217; button to save your changes.</p>



<p>Now, repeat this process for each product you want Amazon to ship. Just make sure that the SKU in WooCommerce matches the SKU in your FBA inventory. If they don&#8217;t match, the order fulfillment will fail, or the sync won‚Äôt work properly.</p>



<p>Your products are now ready to be automatically fulfilled by Amazon whenever someone places an order in your WooCommerce store.</p>

<p><strong>What Is the Difference Between Amazon FBA and Amazon MCF?</strong></p>



<p>Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is the service for storing, packing, and shipping products sold on Amazon. On the other hand, Multi-Channel Fulfillment (MCF) is a service that uses this same Amazon infrastructure to fulfill orders from other sales channels, such as a <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/woocommerce-tutorial-ultimate-guide/" title="WooCommerce Made Simple: A Step-by-Step Tutorial [+ Resources]">WooCommerce</a> store.</p>



<p><strong>Can I use Amazon FBA to fulfill only some of my WooCommerce products?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, absolutely. You have full control on a per-product basis. </p>



<p>To enable fulfillment for a specific item, you&#8217;ll simply check the &#8216;Fulfill with Amazon FBA&#8217; box in that product&#8217;s settings within your WooCommerce dashboard, as shown in Step 5.</p>



<p><strong>Do I need a Professional Amazon Seller account to connect with WooCommerce?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, you must have a Professional Amazon Seller Central account to use MCF (Multi-Channel Fulfillment) and connect it with WooCommerce. Individual seller accounts are not supported for API integrations like this.</p>



<p><strong>Will WooCommerce automatically update inventory levels from Amazon?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, if inventory sync is enabled in the plugin settings, then stock levels in WooCommerce will be automatically updated based on your Amazon FBA inventory. This helps avoid <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-prevent-overselling-out-of-stock-items-in-wordpress/" title="How to Prevent Overselling Out of Stock Items in WordPress">overselling out-of-stock products</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Does Amazon handle returns for WooCommerce orders?</strong></p>



<p>Amazon does offer return handling for MCF orders, but it depends on your fulfillment settings and region. You&#8217;ll need to enable return management in your Amazon Seller Central account and review their return policies for non-Amazon sales.</p>



<p><strong>How much does it cost to ship orders with Amazon MCF?</strong></p>



<p>Amazon charges fulfillment fees for every order it ships through MCF. These fees are based on the product&#8217;s size, weight, and the shipping speed selected (Standard, Expedited, Priority). You should review the current Amazon MCF pricing on their website to understand the costs for your specific products.</p>

<p>Relying on email alone often doesn‚Äôt cut it. Messages can get lost in spam, delayed, or ignored if shoppers don‚Äôt check their inboxes.</p>



<p>Switching to WhatsApp made a big difference for me. Notifications arrive instantly, customers actually see them, and I can get real-time updates on every sale.</p>



<p>After testing several options, I‚Äôve narrowed it down to three reliable methods anyone can use. In this guide, I‚Äôll walk you through how to connect WhatsApp with WooCommerce, so you and your customers never miss an update again.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="385" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/how-to-send-woo-order-notifications-in-whatsapp-in-post.png" alt="How I Send WooCommerce Order Notifications Straight to WhatsApp " class="wp-image-363791" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/how-to-send-woo-order-notifications-in-whatsapp-in-post.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/how-to-send-woo-order-notifications-in-whatsapp-in-post-300x170.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-why-you-need-whatsapp-order-notifications">Why Set Up WooCommerce Order Notifications in WhatsApp?</h4>



<p>Relying only on email for WooCommerce order updates can cause issues. Emails can end up in spam, show up hours late, or just get lost in a busy inbox.</p>



<p>WhatsApp solves this by sending instant updates straight to your customer‚Äôs phone, so they never miss an important update.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a closer look at how connecting <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/woocommerce-tutorial-ultimate-guide/" title="WooCommerce Made Simple: A Step-by-Step Tutorial [+ Resources]">WooCommerce</a> and WhatsApp can be helpful:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>People check WhatsApp more.</strong>&nbsp;Many customers are on WhatsApp all day, while email gets ignored.</li>



<li><strong>Messages get read quickly.</strong>&nbsp;WhatsApp notifications are opened almost right away.</li>



<li><strong>Fewer customer questions.</strong>&nbsp;If shoppers get updates instantly, they don&#8217;t have to contact you for answers.</li>



<li><strong>Real-time updates build trust.</strong>&nbsp;Customers always know when their order is confirmed, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-offer-shipment-tracking-in-woocommerce/" title="How to Offer Shipment Tracking in WooCommerce (Step by Step)">shipped</a>, or refunded.</li>
</ul>



<p>With WhatsApp, your messages actually reach customers, which means less confusion and a smoother shopping experience.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-which-method-should-i-choose">Which Method Should I Choose?</h5>



<p>In this guide, I‚Äôll cover 3 ways to send WooCommerce order notifications in WhatsApp. Here&#8217;s how I recommend choosing between them:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Method 1: PushEngage.</strong> Best for an all-in-one marketing platform. Send automated WhatsApp order updates to customers and your team, alongside <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-push-notification-software-for-websites-compared/" title="Best Web Push Notification Software (Compared)">push notifications</a>, cart recovery messages, and promotions.</li>



<li><strong>Method 2: Uncanny Automator.</strong> Set up custom ‚Äúrecipes‚Äù to trigger WhatsApp messages from WooCommerce events, with flexible automation options.</li>



<li><strong>Method 3: Wawp</strong>. A simple free option that connects to your personal or business phone (similar to WhatsApp Web). It&#8217;s ideal for testing or small stores, but your phone must remain on and connected to the internet for it to work.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you choose either method 1 or 2, you&#8217;ll also need to set up a WhatsApp Business account and message templates within WhatsApp. </p>



<p>Now, I&#8217;ll walk through each method step by step:</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s get started.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-before-you-start-setup-a-whatsapp-business-account">Before You Start: Set Up Your WhatsApp Business Account (For Methods 1 &amp; 2)</h4>



<p>To connect your WooCommerce store with WhatsApp, you&#8217;ll need to set up a WhatsApp Business Suite account, generate a permanent token, and create WooCommerce message templates.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a quick checklist of what you‚Äôll need before you start:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A Meta Business Suite account (or be ready to create one).</li>



<li>Admin access to that account.</li>



<li>A phone number that is <strong>not</strong> currently registered with a personal WhatsApp account. You&#8217;ll need this number exclusively for your business notifications.</li>
</ul>



<p>In the next sections, I‚Äôll guide you through each of these steps.</p>



<p></p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-1-set-up-a-whatsapp-business-account">Step 1: Create a WhatsApp Business Account</h5>



<p>If you don&#8217;t already have a Meta Business Suite account, you can create one on the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="Meta website">Meta website</a>.</p>



<p>Just click &#8216;Create a New Account&#8217; to sign up and complete the quick setup steps. Do note that you&#8217;ll need to verify your business information, which can take 1-2 business days.</p>


<div class="wpb-alert style-yellow">

<p><strong>üí°</strong> <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The exact steps may vary slightly since Meta updates their interface from time to time, so don‚Äôt worry if things look a little different on your screen.</p>

</div>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="418" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-createanewaccount.png" alt="Creating a Meta Business account" class="wp-image-364676" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-createanewaccount.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-createanewaccount-300x184.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>After creating your app, you‚Äôll land on the app dashboard.</p>



<p>Go ahead and click the &#8216;Create App&#8217; button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="311" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-apps-createapp.png" alt="Creating an app" class="wp-image-364677" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-apps-createapp.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-apps-createapp-300x137.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>This will start the app setup wizard.</p>



<p>Here, simply fill in the &#8216;App name&#8217; and &#8216;App contact email&#8217; fields. This is for your reference only, but it&#8217;s helpful to have a clear, descriptive name.</p>



<p>After that, click the &#8216;Next&#8217; button to continue the process.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="336" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-apps-createapp-appdetails.png" alt="Adding the app details" class="wp-image-364678" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-apps-createapp-appdetails.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-apps-createapp-appdetails-300x148.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>On the next screen, you&#8217;ll choose a use case.</p>



<p>As we want to send a WooCommerce order notification to WhatsApp, let&#8217;s select &#8216;Connect with customers through WhatsApp&#8217; and click &#8216;Next.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="461" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-apps-createapp-usecases.png" alt="Choosing a use case" class="wp-image-364679" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-apps-createapp-usecases.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-apps-createapp-usecases-300x203.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>After that, you‚Äôll need to link your business portfolio. Just click on the available option and click the &#8216;Next&#8217; button to move on.</p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t have one, you can just click on the &#8216;Create a business portfolio&#8217; link.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="287" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-apps-createapp-business.png" alt="Choosing a business" class="wp-image-364681" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-apps-createapp-business.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-apps-createapp-business-300x127.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>This will open a popup where you‚Äôll enter your first name, last name, and <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-create-a-free-business-email-address-in-5-minutes-step-by-step/" title="How to Create a Free Business Email Address (in Just 5 Minutes)">business email address</a>.</p>



<p>Once done, click &#8216;Create Portfolio.&#8217;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="348" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-apps-createapp-createabusinessporto.png" alt="Creating a business portfolio" class="wp-image-364680" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-apps-createapp-createabusinessporto.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-apps-createapp-createabusinessporto-300x154.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Meta will then prompt you to verify your business portfolio.</p>



<p>Simply click &#8216;Start Verification&#8217; and follow the on-screen instructions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="387" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-apps-createapp-createabusinessporto-startverification.png" alt="Click the Start Verification button" class="wp-image-364682" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-apps-createapp-createabusinessporto-startverification.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-apps-createapp-createabusinessporto-startverification-300x171.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>The next step is to review requirements.</p>



<p>For WhatsApp-related apps, there typically won&#8217;t be any requirements identified. So you can go ahead and click the &#8216;Next&#8217; button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="249" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-apps-createapp-requirements.png" alt="Reviewing requirements" class="wp-image-364683" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-apps-createapp-requirements.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-apps-createapp-requirements-300x110.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>And for the last step, you‚Äôll see a summary of your new WhatsApp Notification app.</p>



<p>You can review everything and then click &#8216;Go to Dashboard.&#8217;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="429" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-apps-createapp-gotodashboard.png" alt="Click Go to Dashboard" class="wp-image-364684" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-apps-createapp-gotodashboard.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metadeveloper-apps-createapp-gotodashboard-300x189.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>From the dashboard, you‚Äôll see a prompt to set up the WhatsApp Business Platform.</p>



<p>Here, you&#8217;ll want to click the &#8216;Customize the Connect with customers through WhatsApp use case&#8217; button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="397" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize.png" alt="Customizing app in the app dashboard" class="wp-image-364686" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-300x175.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>On the next screen, you&#8217;ll see a prompt to start WhatsApp Business Platform configuration.</p>



<p>Go ahead and click the &#8216;Continue&#8217; button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="470" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-businessplatform-continue.png" alt="Customizing WhatsApp business platform" class="wp-image-364687" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-businessplatform-continue.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-businessplatform-continue-300x207.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>After that, you&#8217;ll see a WhatsApp Business Platform welcome message.</p>



<p>From here, you can click the &#8216;Start using the API&#8217; button to start.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="231" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-businessplatform-apisetup.png" alt="WhatsApp API Setup" class="wp-image-364688" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-businessplatform-apisetup.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-businessplatform-apisetup-300x102.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Then, in the &#8216;API Setup&#8217; panel, you&#8217;ll need to register your <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-virtual-business-phone-number-apps-free-options/" title="7 Best Virtual Business Phone Number Apps (Free &amp; Paid)">phone number</a>. Otherwise, Meta will use a test number to send your messages.</p>



<p>Click to expand the dropdown and then hit the &#8216;+ Add phone number&#8217; button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="362" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-businessplatform-apisetup-addphonenumber.png" alt="Open dropdown to click Add phone number" class="wp-image-364689" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-businessplatform-apisetup-addphonenumber.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-businessplatform-apisetup-addphonenumber-300x160.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>This will open a setup wizard for your WhatsApp configuration.</p>



<p>First, enter your business name, enter your <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-make-a-small-business-website-step-by-step/" title="How to Make a Small Business Website ‚Äì Step by Step">business website address</a>, and choose your country.

<p>After that, let&#8217;s set up your WhatsApp Business Platform account, which includes details like display name, timezone, category, and business description.</p>



<p>Click &#8216;Next&#8217; to proceed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="434" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-businessplatform-apisetup-addphonenumber-wabusinessprofile.png" alt="Setting up WA Business Profile" class="wp-image-364691" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-businessplatform-apisetup-addphonenumber-wabusinessprofile.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-businessplatform-apisetup-addphonenumber-wabusinessprofile-300x191.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>After that, go ahead and add your active phone number for WhatsApp.</p>



<p>Then, you can tick the radio button to confirm it through SMS or a phone call and click &#8216;Next&#8217; to proceed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="285" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-businessplatform-apisetup-addphonenumber-addnumber.png" alt="Entering your phone number" class="wp-image-364692" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-businessplatform-apisetup-addphonenumber-addnumber.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-businessplatform-apisetup-addphonenumber-addnumber-300x126.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>In a few minutes, you should receive a verification code via SMS or phone call (depending on your choice in the previous step).</p>



<p>Once you have it, simply enter the 6-digit code in the field and click &#8216;Next.&#8217;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="224" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-businessplatform-apisetup-addphonenumber-verifynumber.png" alt="Verifying the phone number" class="wp-image-364693" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-businessplatform-apisetup-addphonenumber-verifynumber.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-businessplatform-apisetup-addphonenumber-verifynumber-300x99.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Upon verification, you‚Äôll see a &#8216;Generate access token&#8217; button.</p>



<p>Go ahead and click on it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="145" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-businessplatform-generate-accesstoken.png" alt="Generating temporary access token" class="wp-image-364694" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-businessplatform-generate-accesstoken.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-businessplatform-generate-accesstoken-300x64.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>In the popup that appears, you&#8217;ll choose the WhatsApp account you want to give permissions to send notifications.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll see the phone number you just registered and the test number that Meta provides. Let&#8217;s click on your registered phone number.</p>



<p>Meta will then ask you to grant your permission to send messages on your behalf.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="401" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-businessplatform-generate-accesstoken-choosewaaccount.png" alt="Choose a WhatsApp account" class="wp-image-364696" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-businessplatform-generate-accesstoken-choosewaaccount.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-customize-businessplatform-generate-accesstoken-choosewaaccount-300x177.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Meta will then take you back to the &#8216;API Setup&#8217; panel, where you can see your access token. Simply click the copy icon and store it somewhere safe, like a notepad.</p>



<p>Keep in mind, this token only lasts for 24 hours.</p>



<p>In addition to that, you&#8217;ll need to keep your &#8216;Phone number ID&#8217; and &#8216;WhatsApp Business Account ID&#8217; somewhere safe.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="412" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-copy-accesstoken-waid-phoneid.png" alt="Copy access token, WA ID, and phone number ID" class="wp-image-364697" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-copy-accesstoken-waid-phoneid.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-appdashboard-copy-accesstoken-waid-phoneid-300x182.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>With that done, you&#8217;ll get your WhatsApp Business Platform account.</p>



<p>You can access it through <a href="https://business.facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="Meta Business Suite">Meta Business Suite</a>.</p>



<p>In this account, you can create, manage, and track all your automated WhatsApp messages. Here&#8217;s what the <a href="https://business.facebook.com/latest/whatsapp_manager/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="WhatsApp Manager interface">WhatsApp Manager interface</a> looks like:</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-2-get-a-permanent-access-token">Step 2: Get a Permanent Access Token</h5>



<p>So far, we‚Äôve set things up so you can use WhatsApp on your WordPress site, but the access token you made earlier only works for 24 hours.</p>



<p>To ensure your automations can run 24/7, you‚Äôll need a <strong>permanent access token</strong>.</p>



<p>The way to get one is by creating a &#8216;System user&#8217; in your <a href="https://business.facebook.com/settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="Business Settings">Meta Business Settings</a>. Think of a &#8216;System user&#8217; as a dedicated robot account that gives your tools (like PushEngage or Uncanny Automator) lasting permission to send messages on your behalf.</p>



<p>From your Business Settings, go ahead and select your business.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="289" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metabusinessmanager-business.png" alt="Select a business in Meta business manager" class="wp-image-366289" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metabusinessmanager-business.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metabusinessmanager-business-300x128.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>On the next screen, let&#8217;s look at the left menu and go to &#8216;Settings.&#8217;</p>



<p>From here, you can click&nbsp;&#8216;System users&#8217; and hit the&nbsp;&#8216;Add&#8217;&nbsp;button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="314" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-add.png" alt="Adding a system user in Meta" class="wp-image-366257" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-add.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-add-300x139.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>In the popup that appears, go ahead and give your system user a name.</p>



<p>Then, select&nbsp;&#8216;Admin&#8217;&nbsp;as the role and click&nbsp;&#8216;Create system user.&#8217;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="384" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-add-createsystemuser.png" alt="Create system user name and role" class="wp-image-366258" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-add-createsystemuser.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-add-createsystemuser-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Once that‚Äôs done, you‚Äôll be back on the &#8216;System users&#8217; page.</p>



<p>Here, click on the three-dot button on the right and select &#8216;Assign Assets.&#8217;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="213" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-more-assignassets.png" alt="Assigning assets in Meta" class="wp-image-366286" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-more-assignassets.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-more-assignassets-300x94.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>In the popup that appears, you&#8217;ll need to assign permissions.</p>



<p>To do this, you can click &#8216;Apps,&#8217; select your asset, and switch the &#8216;Manage app&#8217; on in the &#8216;Full control&#8217; section.</p>



<p>With that done, go ahead and click the &#8216;Assign assets&#8217; button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="409" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-assignassets-apps-wanotif-fullcontrol.png" alt="Enabling full control in a Meta asset" class="wp-image-366260" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-assignassets-apps-wanotif-fullcontrol.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-assignassets-apps-wanotif-fullcontrol-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Meta will then ask you to review and accept their non-discrimination policy.</p>



<p>Basically, this tells you that you agree not to use Facebook‚Äôs advertising tools for anything that discriminates against people based on things like race, religion, gender, age, or other protected characteristics.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs just their way to make sure everyone is treated fairly and that ads follow the law.</p>



<p>Once granted, you&#8217;ll see the &#8216;Asset assigned&#8217; message. Simply click the &#8216;Done&#8217; button or &#8216;X&#8217; to close this popup.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="466" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-assetassigned.png" alt="Assets assigned message in Meta" class="wp-image-366261" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-assetassigned.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-assetassigned-300x206.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>This will take you back to the &#8216;System users&#8217; page.</p>



<p>And you should now see a&nbsp;&#8216;Generate Token&#8217;&nbsp;button in your system user. Let&#8217;s click on that.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="197" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-generatetoken.png" alt="Generating token in System users" class="wp-image-366262" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-generatetoken.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-generatetoken-300x87.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>In the window that pops up, you&#8217;ll see a 4-step setup wizard for your permanent token.</p>



<p>From here, you can select your app from the dropdown menu and then click the &#8216;Next&#8217; button to continue.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="477" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-generatetoken-selectapp.png" alt="Selecting app to generate permanent token" class="wp-image-366267" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-generatetoken-selectapp.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-generatetoken-selectapp-300x210.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>You can then set when the token should expire.</p>



<p>Make sure to choose &#8216;Never&#8217; and click on &#8216;Next.&#8217;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="472" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-generatetoken-setexpiration-never.png" alt="Setting up token expiration to never" class="wp-image-366268" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-generatetoken-setexpiration-never.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-generatetoken-setexpiration-never-300x208.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>The next step is to assign permissions.</p>



<p>You‚Äôll see a list of options, and you&#8217;ll want to check the boxes for:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>whatsapp_business_management</li>



<li>whatsapp_business_messaging</li>
</ul>



<p>This lets your system user manage your WhatsApp business account and send messages on your behalf. Basically, you‚Äôre giving the necessary access so everything works smoothly.</p>



<p>Once you‚Äôve checked those boxes, just click the&nbsp;&#8216;Next&#8217;&nbsp;button to continue.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="474" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-generatetoken-assignpermissions.png" alt="Assigning permissions for the token" class="wp-image-366265" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-generatetoken-assignpermissions.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-generatetoken-assignpermissions-300x209.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>In the last step, you&#8217;ll see your permanent token.</p>



<p>Just click the &#8216;Copy&#8217; button and &#8216;Done&#8217; to finish this up.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="478" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-generatetoken-done.png" alt="Permanent token generated" class="wp-image-366266" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-generatetoken-done.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-settings-systemusers-generatetoken-done-300x211.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>With that done, I recommend storing this somewhere safe, like a <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/what-is-the-best-way-to-manage-passwords-for-wordpress-beginners/" title="How to Easily and Securely Manage Passwords (Beginner‚Äôs Guide)">password manager</a>.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-2-customize-message-templates-in-whatsapp-business-platform">Step 3: Customize Message Templates in WhatsApp Business Platform</h5>



<p>Before you go on, you&#8217;ll need to create a few automated order messages for your app.</p>



<p>By default, your WhatsApp Business Platform account comes with a <code>hello_world</code> template. It‚Äôs fine for testing, but it‚Äôs not very useful for real order notifications.</p>



<p>That‚Äôs why we‚Äôll add new templates tailored to your store. This way, your WhatsApp notifications are more relevant, branded, and effective.</p>


<div class="wpb-alert style-orange">

If you skip this step, you‚Äôll only be able to use the basic <code>hello_world</code> template for automation.</p>

<p>Inside your WhatsApp Manager, head over to the &#8216;Message templates&#8217; section.</p>



<p>Here, you‚Äôll find the &#8216;Template library,&#8217; which includes pre-made templates that you can customize and activate right away.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="326" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/whatsappmanager-messagetemplates-templatelibrary.png" alt="Template library in WhatsApp manager" class="wp-image-365013" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/whatsappmanager-messagetemplates-templatelibrary.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/whatsappmanager-messagetemplates-templatelibrary-300x144.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>For this tutorial, though, let‚Äôs create one from scratch. This gives you full control to match <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-build-your-personal-brand-using-wordpress/" title="How to Build Your Personal Brand Using WordPress">your brand</a> voice and set up the right dynamic tags.</p>



<p>Just go to the &#8216;Message templates&#8217; section and click the &#8216;Create Template&#8217; button to open the text editor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="305" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-messagetemplates-createtemplate.png" alt="Creating template in Meta" class="wp-image-364719" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-messagetemplates-createtemplate.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-messagetemplates-createtemplate-300x135.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>On the next screen, you‚Äôll need to pick a template type:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Marketing</strong> ‚Äì for promotions, sales, or offers.</li>



<li><strong>Utility</strong> ‚Äì for order updates, shipping info, or other customer updates.</li>



<li><strong>Authentication</strong> ‚Äì for login codes or password resets.</li>
</ul>



<p>For order notifications, let&#8217;s use the &#8216;Utility&#8217; template since these messages provide customers with order information, not promotions or login details.</p>



<p>Then, there are the &#8216;Default&#8217; and &#8216;Calling permission request&#8217; options:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Default</strong> ‚Äì Lets you send messages about an existing order or customer account. This is the option most <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/woocommerce-tutorial-ultimate-guide/" title="WooCommerce Made Simple: A Step-by-Step Tutorial [+ Resources]">WooCommerce</a> stores will use.</li>



<li><strong>Calling permission request</strong> ‚Äì Asks customers if you can call them on WhatsApp, which usually isn‚Äôt needed for order notifications.</li>
</ul>



<p>For this setup, let&#8217;s click &#8216;Default&#8217; since we only need to send order updates. Click &#8216;Next&#8217; to continue.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="427" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-messagetemplates-setuptemplate-utility.png" alt="Choosing a Utility template" class="wp-image-364720" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-messagetemplates-setuptemplate-utility.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-messagetemplates-setuptemplate-utility-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Next, in the &#8216;Edit template&#8217; section, you can name your template and select your language.</p>



<p>For the template name, Meta will automatically use lowercase and convert spaces to underlines.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="309" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-messagetemplates-edittemplate-nameyourtemplate.png" alt="Naming the template" class="wp-image-364721" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-messagetemplates-edittemplate-nameyourtemplate.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-messagetemplates-edittemplate-nameyourtemplate-300x136.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>After that, you can scroll to the &#8216;Content&#8217; section.</p>



<p>This is where you fine-tune what your message will look like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Choose a variable type ‚Äì</strong> Use either number variables like {{1}}, {{2}} or name variables like {{customer_name}}, {{order_number}}. Both pull in real customer data, but name variables are easier to work with as they show exactly what will appear in your message.</li>



<li><strong>Set up a media sample (optional)</strong> ‚Äì If you plan to add an image, video, or document to your message, you can upload a sample here. But in my opinion, this is better for promotional messages since the media should fit with your text.</li>



<li><strong>Define the message header (optional)</strong> ‚Äì Add a short line of text or an image that appears above your main message. This works well for attention-grabbing details, like ‚Äú<em>Order Update</em>&#8221; or <em>&#8220;Woohoo! Thank you {{customer_name}} for your purchase :D&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>



<p>If you add a header, you can preview your template on the right-hand panel.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="314" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-messagetemplates-edittemplate-header-preview.png" alt="Adding the message header" class="wp-image-364722" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-messagetemplates-edittemplate-header-preview.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-messagetemplates-edittemplate-header-preview-300x139.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>From here, you can edit the message content to match how you normally communicate with customers.</p>



<p>You can add dynamic variables like {{customer_name}}, {{order_number}}, and {{order_total}} to make each message personal. </p>



<p>For example, here&#8217;s my message content:</p>



<p><em>&#8220;We‚Äôve received your order #{{order_number}} and it‚Äôs already being prepared. Here‚Äôs a quick summary:</em><br><em>üí∞ Total: {{order_total}}<br>üöö Shipping to: {{shipping_address}}</em><br><em>Thanks again for choosing {{store_name}} üíô&#8221;</em></p>



<p>As with the header, you can immediately see what it looks like under &#8216;Template preview&#8217; on the right.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="346" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-messagetemplates-edittemplate-content-and-preview.png" alt="Personalizing new order message content" class="wp-image-364796" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-messagetemplates-edittemplate-content-and-preview.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-messagetemplates-edittemplate-content-and-preview-300x153.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Next, let&#8217;s scroll down to &#8216;Variable samples.&#8217;</p>



<p>Here, you can use sample data to preview your dynamic variables.</p>



<p>You can also add a message footer, like &#8220;<em>Have questions? Contact us at support@[store].com</em>.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="285" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-messagetemplates-edittemplate-variablesamples-and-preview.png" alt="Testing message template with variable samples" class="wp-image-364797" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-messagetemplates-edittemplate-variablesamples-and-preview.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-messagetemplates-edittemplate-variablesamples-and-preview-300x126.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Once everything looks good, click the &#8216;Submit for review&#8217; button to save and activate this template.</p>



<p>The process is similar for all order notifications, so you can set up as many as you need. For example:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Admin notification template</strong> ‚Äì notifies your team when a new order comes in.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-offer-shipment-tracking-in-woocommerce/" title="How to Offer Shipment Tracking in WooCommerce (Step by Step)">Shipping</a> notification template</strong> ‚Äì updates customers when their order is on the way.</li>



<li><strong>Order complete template</strong> ‚Äì confirms delivery and thanks the customer. You can also include return and refund information here.</li>
</ul>



<p>After creating all the message templates you need, you&#8217;ll see them in your Meta dashboard&#8217;s Message Templates section. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what it might look like:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="308" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-messagetemplates.png" alt="All custom message templates in Meta" class="wp-image-364799" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-messagetemplates.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-messagetemplates-300x136.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Now, you can move on to using either <a href="#aioseo-method-1-send-woocommerce-order-notifications-in-whatsapp-with-pushengage" title="">Method 1</a> or <a href="#aioseo-method-2-send-woocommerce-order-notifications-in-whatsapp-automation-focused" title="Method 2">Method 2</a> below. </p>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve finished signing up, you can install and activate PushEngage on your WordPress site.</p>



<p>Just head to your WordPress dashboard and go to<strong> Plugins ¬ª Add New</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="315" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/wp-plugins-addnew.png" alt="The Add New Plugin submenu under Plugins in the WordPress admin area" class="wp-image-332530" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/wp-plugins-addnew.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/wp-plugins-addnew-300x139.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>On the next screen, you can search for &#8220;PushEngage&#8221; and click &#8216;Install Now,&#8217; then &#8216;Activate.&#8217;</p>



<p>Once activated, you&#8217;ll see a new PushEngage menu in your WordPress dashboard. For details, see our guide on <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/" title="How to Install a WordPress Plugin ‚Äì Step by Step for Beginners">how to install a WordPress plugin</a>.</p>

<p>Go ahead and click the &#8216;Connect Your Existing Account&#8217; button to launch the setup wizard. You can follow the instructions from here. </p>

<p>In this step, you&#8217;ll link your WhatsApp Business Platform account to PushEngage. This is where those API credentials you generated before will come in handy. </p>



<p>From your WordPress dashboard, navigate to <strong>PushEngage <strong>¬ª</strong> WhatsApp</strong> and then switch to the &#8216;Settings&#8217; tab.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="381" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pushengage-whatsapp-settings.png" alt="Settings tab in PushEngages' WhatsApp menu" class="wp-image-364700" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pushengage-whatsapp-settings.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pushengage-whatsapp-settings-300x168.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>On the next screen, you&#8217;ll see two tabs.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s go to the &#8216;WhatsApp Cloud API&#8217; tab.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="335" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pushengage-whatsapp-settings-wacloudapi.png" alt="The WA Cloud API tab" class="wp-image-364701" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pushengage-whatsapp-settings-wacloudapi.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pushengage-whatsapp-settings-wacloudapi-300x148.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>From here, you should see the WhatsApp Cloud API settings.</p>



<p>Simply enter your permanent token, phone number ID, and any other required information from your Meta Business setup.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="379" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pushengage-whatsapp-settings-wacloudapi-form.png" alt="Completing the WhatsApp Cloud API details" class="wp-image-364702" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pushengage-whatsapp-settings-wacloudapi-form.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pushengage-whatsapp-settings-wacloudapi-form-300x167.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Once that&#8217;s done, click the &#8216;Save Changes&#8217; button to store your settings.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-5-create-whatsapp-notification-automation-in-pushengage">Step 3: Create WhatsApp Notification Automation in PushEngage</h5>



<p>The next step is to assign your custom message templates to the PushEngage automation.</p>



<p>Navigate to <strong>PushEngage <strong><strong>¬ª</strong></strong> WhatsApp</strong> and click on the &#8216;Automation&#8217; tab.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="283" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pushengage-whatsapp-automation.png" alt="The Automation tab in PushEngage" class="wp-image-364707" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pushengage-whatsapp-automation.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pushengage-whatsapp-automation-300x125.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>In this tab, you&#8217;ll see a list of ready-made workflows, like: </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>New Order</strong> ‚Äì triggers as soon as a customer places an order.</li>



<li><strong>Order Processing</strong> ‚Äì activates when you start preparing the order for shipment.</li>



<li><strong>Order Completed</strong> ‚Äì sends a message once the order has shipped.</li>



<li><strong>Order Cancelled</strong> ‚Äì notifies the customer if an order is cancelled.</li>



<li><strong>Order Refunded</strong> ‚Äì useful if you handle returns or issue refunds often.</li>
</ul>



<p>For this tutorial, I&#8217;ll show you how to create a new order notification. So let&#8217;s click on the toggle for the &#8216;New Order&#8217; option.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="286" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pushengage-whatsapp-automation-neworder.png" alt="Enabling New Order notification" class="wp-image-364709" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pushengage-whatsapp-automation-neworder.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pushengage-whatsapp-automation-neworder-300x126.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>In the popup that appears, you can choose to send notifications to customers, store admins, or both.</p>



<p>Customer notifications keep buyers informed, while <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-add-a-notification-center-in-wordpress/" title="How to Add a Notification Center in WordPress Admin">admin notifications</a> help you track new sales in real time. </p>



<p>In the customer notification section, you can:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Enable &#8216;Send notification to customer&#8217;</strong> ‚Äì to send notifications to shoppers.</li>



<li><strong>Specify the customer phone</strong> ‚Äì open the dropdown and select the appropriate option, for example, &#8216;Billing Phone.&#8217;</li>



<li><strong>Choose a message template</strong> ‚Äì pick the <code>new_order_notifications</code> template you just created.</li>
</ul>



<p>Once a template is selected, click the &#8216;Add Variable&#8217; dropdown and insert the relevant variables for each field.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="402" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pushengage-automation-neworder-customer-notifications.png" alt="Customer details for the new order notification" class="wp-image-364802" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pushengage-automation-neworder-customer-notifications.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pushengage-automation-neworder-customer-notifications-300x177.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Then, you can scroll down to enable the admin notification.</p>



<p>Simply tick the &#8216;Send notification to admin&#8217; checkbox, enter the admin&#8217;s phone number, and set up a message template along with its variables.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="297" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pushengage-automation-neworder-admin-notifications.png" alt="Admin details for the new order notification" class="wp-image-364803" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pushengage-automation-neworder-admin-notifications.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pushengage-automation-neworder-admin-notifications-300x131.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>You can then repeat this process for all the automated WhatsApp notifications you want to use.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-6-test-your-whatsapp-notifications">Step 4: Test Your WhatsApp Notifications</h5>



<p>Before going live with customers, I recommend running through a complete test cycle. This process helps you catch any issues with message formatting or timing.</p>



<p>To do this, you can place a test order in your WooCommerce store using your own phone number as the customer contact. Don&#8217;t forget to use a phone number that&#8217;s registered with WhatsApp.</p>



<p>Your first WhatsApp order notification should arrive within a few minutes. It will come with the order details, and you will want to check if it appears in a clean, professional format.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="412" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/whatsapp-new-order-notification.png" alt="WhatsApp new order notification" class="wp-image-365147" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/whatsapp-new-order-notification.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/whatsapp-new-order-notification-300x182.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>If you&#8217;re sending admin notifications too, make sure those are working correctly.</p>



<p>And if you‚Äôve set up order complete notifications, be sure to test those as well. To do this, go to your WooCommerce orders page and update the status of your test order. For example, you can change it from ‚ÄòProcessing‚Äô to ‚ÄòCompleted.‚Äô</p>



<p>That update should trigger the Order Complete workflow, so confirm that the WooCommerce notification arrives in WhatsApp as expected.</p>

<p>After activation, you&#8217;ll see a new &#8216;Automator&#8217; menu in your <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/13-plugins-and-tips-to-improve-wordpress-admin-area/" title="Plugins and Tips to Improve WordPress Admin Area">WordPress admin area</a>.</p>

<p>To connect Uncanny Automator with WhatsApp, go to <strong>Automator ¬ª Settings ¬ª App Integrations ¬ª WhatsApp</strong>.</p>

<p>From here, you can paste in your permanent token, phone number ID, and WhatsApp Business Account ID from the Meta dashboard.</p>



<p>And once again, click on the &#8216;Connect WhatsApp account&#8217; button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="321" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-appintegrations-whatsapp-form-connect.png" alt="Connecting WhatsApp to Uncanny Automator" class="wp-image-364877" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-appintegrations-whatsapp-form-connect.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-appintegrations-whatsapp-form-connect-300x142.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>After a few seconds, you&#8217;ll get a success message.</p>



<p>And here&#8217;s what it looks like:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="367" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-appintegrations-whatsapp-connect-successful.png" alt="Successful WhatsApp and Uncanny Automator integration" class="wp-image-364881" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-appintegrations-whatsapp-connect-successful.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-appintegrations-whatsapp-connect-successful-300x162.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-4-create-your-whatsapp-notification-automation-recipe">Step 2: Create Your WhatsApp Notification Automation Recipe</h5>



<p>Automator uses &#8220;recipes&#8221; to describe automations. Think of them like &#8220;if-then rules&#8221; that connect different parts of your website. Each recipe has triggers (what starts the automation) and actions (what happens as a result).</p>



<p>To create your automation recipe, let&#8217;s first navigate to <strong>Automator ¬ª Add new recipe</strong> in your WordPress dashboard.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="411" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/automator-addnewrecipe.png" alt="Add new recipe in Automator" class="wp-image-361042" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/automator-addnewrecipe.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/automator-addnewrecipe-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>In the popup that appears, you&#8217;ll see a modal asking what type of recipe you want to create.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s choose &#8216;Everyone&#8217; as the recipe type and click &#8216;Confirm.&#8217;</p>



<p>This way, your automation will work for both customers with accounts and those who <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-create-faster-checkout-in-woocommerce/" title="How to Create Faster Checkout in WooCommerce (Expert Tips)">check out as guests</a>. Uncanny Automator can pull the phone number directly from the order details, so notifications will be sent to all purchasers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="387" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/uncanny-automator-everyone.png" alt="Creating an automated recipe for all users" class="wp-image-160551" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/uncanny-automator-everyone.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/uncanny-automator-everyone-300x171.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>In the recipe editor, you can go ahead and give your recipe a descriptive name like &#8220;WhatsApp Notifications for WooCommerce Orders.&#8221; Clear naming helps a lot when you have multiple recipes running.</p>



<p>After that, you can scroll down to set up what event should start your WhatsApp notification.</p>



<p>Automator has dozens of WooCommerce triggers to choose from. In the &#8216;Trigger&#8217; panel, select &#8216;WooCommerce&#8217; (or Woo) from the list of available integrations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="453" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-trigger-woo.png" alt="Choosing WooCommerce as trigger" class="wp-image-364882" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-trigger-woo.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-trigger-woo-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>In the dropdown, you&#8217;ll see various WooCommerce events you can use as triggers.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s choose &#8216;A user purchases a product.&#8217; This trigger fires when someone successfully completes their purchase.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="439" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-trigger-woo-auserpurchaseaproduct.png" alt="A user purchases a product trigger" class="wp-image-364883" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-trigger-woo-auserpurchaseaproduct.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-trigger-woo-auserpurchaseaproduct-300x194.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>If you have the Pro version, you&#8217;ll get more options.</p>



<p>For example, you can choose a more specific trigger like &#8220;A user completes, pays, and lands on a <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-easily-create-custom-woocommerce-thank-you-pages/" title="How to Easily Create Custom WooCommerce Thank You Pages">thank-you page</a> for a variable product with a variation selected.&#8221;</p>



<p>After that, you can set the trigger condition to &#8216;pays for&#8217; so it only runs when payment is actually processed. Then, you can click the &#8216;Save&#8217; button to continue.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="422" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-trigger-woo-triggerconditions.png" alt="Setting up the trigger condition as pays for" class="wp-image-364884" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-trigger-woo-triggerconditions.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-trigger-woo-triggerconditions-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Then, you&#8217;ll need to specify your product selection.</p>



<p>You can choose &#8216;Any product,&#8217; unless you only want notifications for specific items. Don&#8217;t forget to click &#8216;Save.&#8217;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="373" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-trigger-woo-product.png" alt="Specifying which products to fire trigger" class="wp-image-364885" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-trigger-woo-product.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-trigger-woo-product-300x165.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>The next step is to set up an action. This is what happens after your trigger fires. In other words, this is where you&#8217;ll configure the actual WhatsApp message.</p>



<p>To start, click the &#8216;Add action&#8217; button in the &#8216;Actions&#8217; panel.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="416" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-actions-addaction.png" alt="Adding an action" class="wp-image-364887" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-actions-addaction.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-actions-addaction-300x184.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Then, you can select &#8216;WhatsApp&#8217; from the integration list.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll also notice that there are plenty of other integrations available with Uncanny Automator, including OptinMonster and <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-create-a-custom-airtable-form-in-wordpress/" title="How to Create a Custom Airtable Form in WordPress (Easy Way)">Airtable</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="439" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-actions-whatsapp.png" alt="Selecting WhatsApp integration for action" class="wp-image-364888" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-actions-whatsapp.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-actions-whatsapp-300x194.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Now, you should see different WhatsApp actions available.</p>



<p>Here, you can choose &#8216;Send a WhatsApp message template&#8217; for first-time notifications that need to follow WhatsApp&#8217;s template requirements.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="318" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-actions-whatsapp-sendmessagetemplates.png" alt="Choosing Send a WhatsApp message template for action" class="wp-image-364889" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-actions-whatsapp-sendmessagetemplates.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-actions-whatsapp-sendmessagetemplates-300x140.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Make sure to pick the template that you created in the WhatsApp Manager dashboard. In my example, it&#8217;s called &#8216;new_order_notification&#8217;. </p>



<p>The &#8216;Send a WhatsApp message to a number&#8217; method works better for customers who have already opted in to receive messages.</p>



<p>Remember to click the &#8216;Save&#8217; button when it appears.</p>



<p>In the phone number field, you can use Automator&#8217;s token system to pull the customer&#8217;s billing phone from their order. </p>



<p>Just click the asterisk icon, select the &#8216;Billing phone&#8217; token from <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/woocommerce-tutorial-ultimate-guide/" title="WooCommerce Made Simple: A Step-by-Step Tutorial [+ Resources]">WooCommerce</a>, and click &#8216;Save.&#8217;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="348" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-actions-whatsapp-phonenumber-asterisk-billingphone.png" alt="Choosing the Billing Phone dynamic tag" class="wp-image-364890" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-actions-whatsapp-phonenumber-asterisk-billingphone.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-actions-whatsapp-phonenumber-asterisk-billingphone-300x154.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-5-activate-and-test-your-automation">Step 3: Activate and Test Your Automation</h5>



<p>Now, you can activate your recipe, and Automator makes this easy with their draft and live modes.</p>



<p>To activate your automated WhatsApp notification recipes, you can toggle from &#8216;Draft&#8217; to &#8216;Live&#8217; using the switch at the top of the recipe page.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="382" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-live.png" alt="Making Uncanny Automator recipe live" class="wp-image-364892" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-live.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-recipe-whatsapp-live-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Now, you can place a test order on your online store using your own phone number as the customer contact. Make sure you complete the entire <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-customize-woocommerce-checkout-page/" title="How to Customize WooCommerce Checkout Page (The Easy Way)">WooCommerce checkout</a> process, including payment.</p>



<p>Within a few minutes, you should receive a WhatsApp notification with all the dynamic tokens displaying the correct information from your test order.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="412" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/whatsapp-new-order-notification.png" alt="WhatsApp new order notification" class="wp-image-365147" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/whatsapp-new-order-notification.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/whatsapp-new-order-notification-300x182.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>You can also head to your WooCommerce dashboard and manually change the test order‚Äôs status from ‚ÄòProcessing‚Äô to ‚ÄòCompleted‚Äô.</p>



<p>This will trigger any extra notifications you‚Äôve configured.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="216" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/whatsapp-order-complete-notification.png" alt="WhatsApp order complete notification" class="wp-image-365148" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/whatsapp-order-complete-notification.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/whatsapp-order-complete-notification-300x95.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>That&#8217;s all!</p>



<p>And to monitor all your automation activity, you can go to the <strong>Automator ¬ª Logs</strong> section, which shows you exactly when recipes run and whether they succeed or cause errors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="375" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-logs-recipes.png" alt="The logs in Uncanny Automator" class="wp-image-365151" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-logs-recipes.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uncanny-logs-recipes-300x165.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>

<p>Start by clicking the &#8216;Start Free Forever&#8217; button, filling in your account details, and verifying your WhatsApp number.</p>



<p>The free plan lets you send up to 50 messages per month, so you can experiment with order updates without any upfront cost. When you‚Äôre ready, it‚Äôs easy to upgrade or move to a more advanced solution like PushEngage or Uncanny Automator. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="360" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-site.png" alt="Wawp's site" class="wp-image-364818" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-site.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-site-300x159.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>In your account dashboard, you&#8217;ll see the setup wizard.</p>



<p>The first thing to do here is click the &#8216;Connect Now&#8217; button to launch the wizard.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="344" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-setup-connectnow.png" alt="Connect now button" class="wp-image-364819" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-setup-connectnow.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-setup-connectnow-300x152.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>This will take you to the &#8216;Linked Numbers&#8217; panel, where Wawp will prompt you to create a new instance.</p>



<p>An instance is like a workspace that links your WhatsApp number to Wawp. Think of it as the bridge between your Wawp account and your <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/guides/" title="How to Make a WordPress Website (Ultimate Guide)">WordPress website</a>. Without it, your store can‚Äôt send or receive WhatsApp messages.</p>



<p>Go ahead and click on the &#8216;Create New Instance&#8217; button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="258" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-setup-createnewinstance.png" alt="Creating new instance" class="wp-image-364820" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-setup-createnewinstance.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-setup-createnewinstance-300x114.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Here&#8217;s where Wawp&#8217;s approach differs significantly from the other methods. Instead of a complex API setup, you simply scan a QR code with your phone.</p>



<p>Just click the &#8216;Scan QR&#8217; button, and in your phone, tap &#8216;Link a Device&#8217; and use your phone&#8217;s camera to scan the QR code from your computer screen.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="237" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-setup-createnewinstance-scanqr.png" alt="Scanning QR to create new instance" class="wp-image-364821" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-setup-createnewinstance-scanqr.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-setup-createnewinstance-scanqr-300x105.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Once connected, Wawp will show you the &#8216;Connected&#8217; label and generate the &#8216;Instance ID&#8217; for your account automatically.</p>



<p>On this page, you can also see your &#8216;Access Token.&#8217;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s copy both pieces of information, as you&#8217;ll need them in step 2.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="273" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-accesstoken-instanceid.png" alt="Copying access token and instance id" class="wp-image-364822" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-accesstoken-instanceid.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-accesstoken-instanceid-300x120.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>With that done, you can start installing the Wawp plugin.</p>



<p>In your WordPress dashboard, go to <strong>Plugins ¬ª Add New</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="315" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/wp-plugins-addnew.png" alt="The Add New Plugin submenu under Plugins in the WordPress admin area" class="wp-image-332530" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/wp-plugins-addnew.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/wp-plugins-addnew-300x139.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>On the next screen, simply use the search bar to find the Wawp plugin.</p>



<p>When you see the plugin in the search results, click the &#8216;Install Now&#8217; button. Then, once again, on &#8216;Activate&#8217; to complete the process.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="401" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wp-plugin-addplugin-wawp.png" alt="Installing Wawp in WordPress" class="wp-image-364843" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wp-plugin-addplugin-wawp.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wp-plugin-addplugin-wawp-300x177.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Upon activation, you&#8217;ll notice a new &#8216;Wawp&#8217; menu item appears in your WordPress dashboard. </p>



<p>For a step-by-step guide, see <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/" title="How to Install a WordPress Plugin ‚Äì Step by Step for Beginners">how to install a WordPress plugin</a>.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-2-connect-your-wordrpess-site-and-your-wawp-account">Step 2: Connect Your WordPress Site and Your Wawp Account</h5>



<p>Now that you have Wawp installed on your site, let&#8217;s connect both platforms.</p>



<p>From your dashboard, you&#8217;ll want to navigate to <strong>Wawp <strong>¬ª</strong> Sender Settings</strong>. Then, in the &#8216;Connect your WhatsApp&#8217; section, go ahead and click &#8216;+ Add Manually.&#8217;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="229" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-sendersettings-whatsappweb-manualconnection.png" alt="Choosing manual connection for Wawp and WordPress" class="wp-image-364827" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-sendersettings-whatsappweb-manualconnection.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-sendersettings-whatsappweb-manualconnection-300x101.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>This will open a popup where you can fill in your instance details.</p>



<p>Simply copy and paste your instance name, instance ID, and access token into the relevant fields. After that, click &#8216;Save&#8217; to continue.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="362" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-sendersettings-whatsappweb-addinstancemanually.png" alt="Connecting an instance in WordPress" class="wp-image-364828" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-sendersettings-whatsappweb-addinstancemanually.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-sendersettings-whatsappweb-addinstancemanually-300x160.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>This will redirect you to the &#8216;Sender Settings&#8217; panel.</p>



<p>In the &#8216;Connected Numbers&#8217; section, you should be able to see your instance added. The &#8216;Online&#8217; connection status indicates that the link is successful.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="251" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-sendersettings-whatsappweb-online.png" alt="Instance connected" class="wp-image-364829" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-sendersettings-whatsappweb-online.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-sendersettings-whatsappweb-online-300x111.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-3-create-automated-woocommerce-order-notifications">Step 3: Create Automated WooCommerce Order Notifications</h5>



<p>By now, you&#8217;re ready to create your WooCommerce order notifications.</p>



<p>In the Wawp plugin settings, look for the &#8216;Notifications Builder&#8217; section and click &#8216;+ New Notification.&#8217;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="359" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-notificationsbuilder-newnotification.png" alt="Adding new notification in Wawp" class="wp-image-364832" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-notificationsbuilder-newnotification.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-notificationsbuilder-newnotification-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>You&#8217;ll then see different WooCommerce events listed in &#8216;Trigger Events.&#8217;</p>



<p>They include &#8216;Order Status: Processing,&#8217; &#8216;Order Status: Completed,&#8217; &#8216;Order Status: Failed,&#8217; and so on. </p>



<p>For the first notification, let&#8217;s choose &#8216;Processing.&#8217;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="357" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-notificationsbuilder-newnotification-triggerevent.png" alt="WooCommerce trigger events" class="wp-image-364833" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-notificationsbuilder-newnotification-triggerevent.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-notificationsbuilder-newnotification-triggerevent-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>This will open the notification template customization panel, where you can adjust the following settings:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Waiting Time</strong> ‚Äì Choose how long to wait before the notification is sent: instant or after a few minutes delay.</li>



<li><strong>Send Via</strong> ‚Äì Select the delivery channel: WhatsApp, email, or both. By default, this is set to WhatsApp.</li>



<li><strong>Send To</strong> ‚Äì Decide who should receive the message: the <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/wordpress-user-roles-and-permissions/" title="Beginner‚Äôs Guide to WordPress User Roles and Permissions">user</a>, the admin, or both.</li>
</ul>



<p>For example, my setup is: &#8216;Instant&#8217; for Waiting Time, &#8216;WhatsApp&#8217; for Send Via, and &#8216;User&#8217; for Send To.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="368" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-notificationsbuilder-newnotification-sendto.png" alt="Send to options" class="wp-image-364834" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-notificationsbuilder-newnotification-sendto.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-notificationsbuilder-newnotification-sendto-300x162.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>If you scroll further down this panel, you‚Äôll find some additional options. For instance, you can choose to include the <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-create-a-woocommerce-product-image-gallery-step-by-step/" title="How to Create a WooCommerce Product Image Gallery (Step by Step)">product image</a> in your WhatsApp notifications.</p>



<p>You‚Äôll also see a few WooCommerce filters that let you control exactly when messages are sent:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-add-country-restriction-for-woocommerce-products/" title="How to Add Country Restriction for WooCommerce Products">Country Filter</a>:</strong> Send or exclude messages based on the customer‚Äôs billing country.</li>



<li><strong>Product Filter:</strong> Target specific products by choosing whether to send or not send messages for them.</li>



<li><strong>Payment Gateway Filter:</strong> Decide which payment methods, like Stripe, bank transfer, check, or COD, should trigger a notification.</li>
</ul>



<p>You can tweak these filters to fit your store‚Äôs workflow and customer base.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="394" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-notificationsbuilder-newnotification-productimage-filter.png" alt="Include product images and filters" class="wp-image-364835" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-notificationsbuilder-newnotification-productimage-filter.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-notificationsbuilder-newnotification-productimage-filter-300x174.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Next, you might want to edit the basic message template.</p>



<p>I personally always customize the message to match how I communicate with customers. Personal touches make a big difference in customer service. </p>



<p>You can scroll up this panel and click the pencil icon to edit the message template. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="295" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-notificationsbuilder-newnotification-edittemplate.png" alt="The Edit Template button in Wawp" class="wp-image-364836" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-notificationsbuilder-newnotification-edittemplate.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-notificationsbuilder-newnotification-edittemplate-300x130.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>In the popup that appears, you can type your custom message into the text field.</p>



<p>You might also notice that Wawp supports dynamic tags like {Order_ID}, {Display_Name}, and {Order_Total}. These tags automatically fill in information from each specific order.</p>



<p>So, for example, you might write:</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>Hello {display_name}, thanks for shopping with {site_title}!</em><br><em>We‚Äôve received your order #{order_id} and it‚Äôs now being processed. üõí&nbsp;</em><br><em>Have questions? Just reply to this message and our team will be happy to help! ‚ú®&nbsp;</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t forget to click &#8216;Finish &amp; Save&#8217; to apply your custom WhatsApp message.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="427" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-notificationsbuilder-newnotification-editmessage-dynamicvariables.png" alt="Dynamic tags in Wawp" class="wp-image-364837" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-notificationsbuilder-newnotification-editmessage-dynamicvariables.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-notificationsbuilder-newnotification-editmessage-dynamicvariables-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>You can repeat this process for all the order notifications you want to send through WhatsApp. For most stores, I think new order and order complete notifications are a good start.</p>



<p>Once you&#8217;re finished with your automated WhatsApp notifications, you can see them all listed in your Wawp&#8217;s notification builders like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="288" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-notificationsbuilder-notifications-processing-completed.png" alt="WhatsApp order notifications in Wawp" class="wp-image-364840" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-notificationsbuilder-notifications-processing-completed.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-notificationsbuilder-notifications-processing-completed-300x127.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-4-test-your-automated-whatsapp-notification-setup">Step 4: Test Your Automated WhatsApp Notification Setup</h5>



<p>In this final step, let&#8217;s make sure everything runs smoothly before real customers receive notifications</p>



<p>You can place a test order in your <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/woocommerce-tutorial-ultimate-guide/" title="WooCommerce Made Simple: A Step-by-Step Tutorial [+ Resources]">WooCommerce store</a> using your own phone number as the customer contact information. Simply complete the entire checkout process as a real customer would.</p>



<p>After that, check that you receive the WhatsApp notification and verify that the dynamic tags are pulling in the correct information from your test order.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="338" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-new-order-notification.png" alt="Wawp's new order notification" class="wp-image-365153" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-new-order-notification.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-new-order-notification-300x150.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Next, go to your WooCommerce admin area and manually update the test order&#8217;s status ‚Äì change it from &#8216;Processing&#8217; to &#8216;Completed,&#8217; for example.</p>



<p>This should trigger any additional notifications you&#8217;ve set up.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="347" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-order-complete-notification.png" alt="Wawp's order complete notification" class="wp-image-365154" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-order-complete-notification.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-order-complete-notification-300x153.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>If everything looks good, your Wawp integration is ready to handle real customer orders. Keep an eye on your message credit usage through the first few weeks to see if you need to upgrade your plan.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s all!</p>



<p>To monitor your automation, go to the &#8216;WhatsApp Web History&#8217; panel in the Wawp menu. This page records the total automated messages logged, sent, read, pending, errors, and unique recipients.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="240" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-whatsappwebhistory-messageshistory.png" alt="WhatsApp Messages History in Wawp" class="wp-image-365155" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-whatsappwebhistory-messageshistory.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wawp-whatsappwebhistory-messageshistory-300x106.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-bonus-tip-add-whatsapp-chatbox-and-share-buttons-in-wordpress">FAQs About Sending WooCommerce Order Notifications in WhatsApp</h4>



<p><strong>What is WhatsApp Business Platform, and how does it work?</strong></p>



<p>The WhatsApp Business Platform is the advanced version of WhatsApp for medium and large businesses. Unlike the regular app, it supports automated customer communication such as order updates, reminders, and <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/6-best-help-desk-customer-support-plugins-for-wordpress/" title="Best WordPress Help Desk Plugins for Customer Support">customer support</a> messages.</p>



<p>It runs through an API, so you‚Äôll connect it to WooCommerce using a plugin or third-party service. Messages are sent based on approved templates, and businesses can reply to customers within a 24-hour support window.</p>



<p><strong>Is WhatsApp Business free or paid?</strong></p>



<p>There are two versions of WhatsApp for business, and they have different costs:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>WhatsApp Business App:</strong>&nbsp;This is a free mobile app. It‚Äôs great for <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-make-a-small-business-website-step-by-step/" title="How to Make a Small Business Website ‚Äì Step by Step">small businesses</a> that want to chat with customers manually, but it does not support the kind of automation we cover in this guide.</li>



<li><strong>WhatsApp Business Platform (API):</strong>&nbsp;This is the powerful tool needed for automation. It is a paid service where Meta charges you per conversation or message. This is the version that tools like PushEngage and Uncanny Automator connect to.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>How do I integrate WhatsApp with WooCommerce?</strong></p>



<p>The easiest way is with a plugin like <a href="https://pushengage.com" target="_blank" title="PushEngage - Best Web Push Notification Software">PushEngage</a>, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/uncanny-automator-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="Uncanny Automator">Uncanny Automator</a>, or <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/automation-web-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="Wawp">Wawp</a>. Once connected, you can automatically send order confirmations, shipping updates, or anything else you need.</p>



<p><strong>Can I send automated WhatsApp messages from WooCommerce for free?</strong></p>



<p>You can use the free WhatsApp Business app for manual replies and basic broadcasts, but it does not support full automation.</p>



<p>For automated order notifications, bulk messages, or <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-setup-woocommerce-abandoned-cart-emails/" title="How to Set Up WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Emails">abandoned cart emails</a>, you‚Äôll need the WhatsApp Business Platform.</p>



<p>While it‚Äôs paid, some categories of customer-initiated messages (for example, replies within 24 hours) are free. So costs will depend on how and when messages are sent.</p>
